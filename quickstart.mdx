## Welcome to Dune

**Ready to transform blockchain data into actionable insights?**   
This guide will fast-track your understanding of how to **query**, **visualize**, and **share** insights using Dune. Let's dive in!

Dune offers many features, but this guide focuses on the essentials you'll need to get started. For more detailed guides, check out our [Analytics Guidelines](/learning-resources) and [Data Tables](/data-catalog/) sections.

### **Prerequisites:**

*   **Dune Account:** You'll need a Dune account to follow along. If you don't already have one, [sign up here](https://dune.com/auth/register).
*   **Basic Knowledge:** Gain a basic understanding of SQL and blockchain concepts to enhance your Dune experience.

## Query blockchain data

Begin by constructing the SQL queries you need using Dune's **Query Editor**, a powerful tool for writing and executing SQL. Check out our detailed guide on **[writing queries](./web-app/query-editor/query-window).**

### 1.  **Create a new query** 
- Open the Query Editor in the Dune interface. 
- Here's an embedded demo to help you get started:

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(66.66666666666666% + 41px)",
    height: 0
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/gT2ctqjvwIuX5xUXPx5S?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Dashboards"
  />
</div>

### 2.  Write SQL

- Analyze daily activity on Ethereum by entering the following SQL:

```sql
--Query to get Ethereum's unique daily active users and passive users in 2023

SELECT  
--truncate time to day
date_trunc('day', block_time) AS time,
-- count distinct addresses that sent transactions
COUNT(distinct "from") AS users,
-- count distinct addresses that received a transaction
COUNT(distinct "to") AS receiving_addresses
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_time > DATE '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY time
```

- **[Run this query now.](https://dune.com/queries/2335378)**


### 3.  Run and save your query
Make sure your work is not lost.
- After crafting your query, run it to verify it executes correctly.
- Click the **"Save"** button at the upper right part of the screen. This saves your query, allowing you to monitor the data continuously.


## Create a visualization
After executing a query, the results are displayed in a table below the Query Editor. The next step is to transform these raw data into a more digestible format through visualization.

### 1.  Create a New Visualization
  - Click on **"New Visualization"**, select your desired chart type, and click **"Add Visualization."**
### 2.  Set data sources
  - Choose the appropriate fields for the x and y axes to shape how your data will be displayed.
### 3.  Customize the visualization settings
  - Adjust the settings to suit your visualization needs, such as formatting axis labels and tick marks to enhance readability.


In the example below, we'll create a line chart to visualize the number of unique daily active users and passive users on Ethereum in 2023. We'll format the axis label and tick label to `0a` to make the numbers more user-friendly.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(66.66666666666666% + 41px)",
    height: 0
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/nNxDjw8vBmp34u3aNU0R?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Dashboards"
  />
</div>

## Present your data
Easily share your insights by creating and customizing a dashboard on Dune. Follow these steps to get started:
### 1.  **Create & name a new dashboard**
- Navigate to the **Create** menu and select **"New Dashboard"**
- Enter a name for your dashboard. This name will also become part of the dashboard's URL slug, **which cannot be changed later.** Choose wisely!
### 2.  **Save and Open**
- Click on **"Save and Open"** to activate your dashboard and move to the editing interface.
### 3. **Edit dashboard & add widgets**
- Click the **"Edit"** button in the top right corner to enter edit mode.
- Click on **"Add Widget"** in the top right corner. 
### 4.  Adjust widget layout
- **Resize:** Drag the bottom right corner of the widget to adjust its size.
- **Move:** Drag the widget to your desired location on the dashboard.
### 5.  Finalize & save your work
- Once your widgets are positioned and customized to your satisfaction, click the **"Save"** button in the top right corner to save your changes.
