# Building dbt Models

Create and manage data transformations using dbt models.

## Model Structure

[TODO: Basic model structure]

## Source Configuration

[TODO: How to reference Dune tables as sources]

## Example Model

```sql
-- models/daily_dex_volume.sql
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as day,
    blockchain,
    project,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM {{ source('dex', 'trades') }}
WHERE block_time > current_date - interval '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
```
