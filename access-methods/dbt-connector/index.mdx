Build data transformation pipelines on top of Dune's blockchain data with write-enabled access to DuneSQL.

## Overview

The dbt Connector provides **write-enabled access** to Dune's data warehouse, allowing you to build sophisticated data transformation pipelines using dbt (data build tool). It uses the same Trino endpoint as the read-only connector but with the `transformations=true` session property enabled.

<Note>
The dbt Connector requires an Enterprise plan. [Contact sales](https://dune.com/enterprise) for access.
</Note>

## Key Features

- **Write Access**: Create tables, views, and materialized views directly in DuneSQL
- **dbt Integration**: Full compatibility with dbt Core and dbt Cloud
- **Version Control**: Manage your data models with Git-based workflows
- **Testing**: Built-in data quality testing with dbt's testing framework
- **Documentation**: Auto-generate documentation for your data models
