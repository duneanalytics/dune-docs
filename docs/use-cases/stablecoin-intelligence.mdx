## Analytics Capabilities

### Total Supply by Chain

```sql
SELECT 
    blockchain,
    symbol,
    SUM(balance) / 1e6 as total_supply_millions
FROM tokens.balances_latest
WHERE symbol IN ('USDT', 'USDC', 'DAI')
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
```

### Cross-chain Flows

```sql
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as day,
    blockchain as destination_chain,
    SUM(amount) / 1e6 as inflow_millions
FROM tokens.transfers
WHERE symbol = 'USDC'
    AND "from" IN (SELECT address FROM labels.addresses WHERE name LIKE '%bridge%')
    AND block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

### Exchange Net Flows

```sql
WITH flows AS (
    SELECT 
        date_trunc('day', block_time) as day,
        SUM(CASE WHEN to IN (SELECT address FROM labels.addresses WHERE category = 'exchange') 
            THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as inflows,
        SUM(CASE WHEN "from" IN (SELECT address FROM labels.addresses WHERE category = 'exchange') 
            THEN amount ELSE 0 END) as outflows
    FROM tokens.transfers
    WHERE symbol = 'USDT'
        AND block_time > now() - interval '30 days'
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
    day,
    inflows / 1e6 as inflows_millions,
    outflows / 1e6 as outflows_millions,
    (inflows - outflows) / 1e6 as net_flow_millions
FROM flows
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

## Market Insights

### What Stablecoin Data Reveals

- **Market sentiment** - Exchange inflows often precede selling pressure
- **DeFi activity** - Stablecoin deposits indicate yield farming activity
- **Cross-chain trends** - Flow patterns show where activity is moving
- **Peg stability** - DEX price data reveals de-peg events

## Example Dashboards

Popular stablecoin dashboards on Dune:
- Stablecoin market cap and dominance
- Exchange flow monitors
- Bridge volume trackers
- Peg stability monitors

## Best Practices

1. **Track net flows, not just volume** - Direction matters more than absolute numbers
2. **Monitor multiple chains** - Stablecoins are multi-chain by nature
3. **Watch for unusual patterns** - Sudden flow changes can signal market events
4. **Combine with price data** - Correlate flows with market movements
