# Protocol Adoption Analytics

Understanding how users interact with your protocol is critical for growth. Dune provides the tools to track adoption metrics, analyze user behavior, and monitor ecosystem health.

## Key Metrics

<CardGroup cols={2}>

<Card title="User Growth" icon="users">
  Track new users, returning users, and cohort retention over time.
</Card>

<Card title="TVL & Deposits" icon="vault">
  Monitor total value locked, deposit flows, and capital efficiency.
</Card>

<Card title="Transaction Volume" icon="arrows-rotate">
  Analyze transaction counts, gas usage, and protocol activity.
</Card>

<Card title="Revenue & Fees" icon="dollar-sign">
  Track protocol revenue, fee generation, and economic sustainability.

## Common Queries

### Daily Active Users

```sql
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT "from") as daily_active_users
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE to = 0xYourProtocolAddress
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

### New vs Returning Users

```sql
WITH first_interaction AS (
    SELECT 
        "from" as user,
        MIN(date_trunc('day', block_time)) as first_day
    FROM ethereum.transactions
    WHERE to = 0xYourProtocolAddress
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', t.block_time) as day,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN date_trunc('day', t.block_time) = f.first_day THEN t."from" END) as new_users,
    COUNT(DISTINCT CASE WHEN date_trunc('day', t.block_time) > f.first_day THEN t."from" END) as returning_users
FROM ethereum.transactions t
JOIN first_interaction f ON t."from" = f.user
WHERE t.to = 0xYourProtocolAddress
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

## Example Dashboards

Explore community dashboards for inspiration:
- Protocol-specific analytics dashboards
- Cross-chain comparison dashboards
- Ecosystem health monitors

## Best Practices

1. **Define your key metrics** - Focus on metrics that directly indicate protocol health
2. **Track cohorts** - Understand how different user segments behave over time
3. **Monitor trends** - Look for patterns in daily, weekly, and monthly data
4. **Benchmark against peers** - Compare your metrics to similar protocols
