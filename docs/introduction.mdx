# Welcome to Dune Docs

Dune is a web-based platform that allows you to query public blockchain data and aggregate it into production-ready dashboards.

Blockchains are open and transparent, but each chain is unique—making it difficult to understand, ingest, and aggregate data. Dune gives you the tools to analyze cross-chain data for different tokens, wallets, and protocols. You can also easily share your work with the community, export and integrate data into your own applications, and more.

## Go through our YouTube Tutorials

We've created tutorials covering all product surfaces of Dune, how to navigate and understand all tables, and how to level up as a crypto data analyst. [Check out the full playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLK3b5d4iK10cIrN8c_au9RrC0_eBCOyR2).

## Why Dune?

Dune—along with our massive community of users and experts—provides powerful tools and analysis of all onchain data. You can find a dashboard for pretty much anything web3-related, including for EVMs like Ethereum, Polygon, and Optimism—and non-EVM chains like Solana and Bitcoin.
