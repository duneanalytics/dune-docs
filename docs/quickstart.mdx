# Quickstart

Convert data into knowledge!

## Welcome to Dune

**Ready to transform blockchain data into actionable insights?**

This guide will fast-track your understanding of how to **query**, **visualize**, and **share** insights using Dune. Let's dive in!

### Prerequisites

- **Dune Account:** You'll need a Dune account to follow along. If you don't already have one, [sign up here](https://dune.com/auth/register).
- **Basic Knowledge:** Gain a basic understanding of SQL and blockchain concepts to enhance your Dune experience.

## Query Blockchain Data

Begin by constructing the SQL queries you need using Dune's **Query Editor**, a powerful tool for writing and executing SQL.

### 1. Create a New Query

Open the Query Editor in the Dune interface.

### 2. Write SQL

Analyze daily activity on Ethereum by entering the following SQL:

```sql
-- Query to get Ethereum's unique daily active users in 2023

SELECT  
  -- truncate time to day
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS time,
  -- count distinct addresses that sent a transaction
  COUNT(distinct "from") AS users,
  -- count distinct addresses that received a transaction
  COUNT(distinct "to") AS receiving_addresses
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_time > DATE '2023-01-01'
GROUP BY time
```

### 3. Run and Save Your Query

- After crafting your query, run it to verify it executes correctly.
- Click the **"Save"** button at the upper right part of the screen.

## Create a Visualization

After executing a query, the results are displayed in a table below the Query Editor. Transform this data into a more digestible format through visualization.

### Steps:
1. Click on **"New Visualization"**, select your desired chart type, and click **"Add Visualization"**
2. Choose the appropriate fields for the x and y axes
3. Customize the visualization settings (formatting axis labels, tick marks, etc.)

## Present Your Data

Easily share your insights by creating and customizing a dashboard on Dune.

### Steps:
1. Navigate to the **Create** menu and select **"New Dashboard"**
2. Enter a name for your dashboard (this becomes part of the URL)
3. Click **"Save and Open"** to activate your dashboard
4. Click **"Edit"** then **"Add Widget"** to add your visualizations
5. Resize and position widgets as needed
6. Click **"Save"** when done

## Recap

**Congratulations!** You've just:
- ✅ Queried blockchain data
- ✅ Created a visualization
- ✅ Presented your data on Dune

Now you can share your dashboard with the world!
