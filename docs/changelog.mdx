# Product updates

> New releases and improvements

<Update label="December 2025" tags={["New releases", "Improvements"]}>

## Domain-Restricted Google SSO (Enterprise)

Team admins can now enable domain restriction via Google SSO in team settings. This forces team members to log in using their company email (e.g., @company.com), preventing non-employees from accessing the workspace. When enabled, all team members are logged out and must re-authenticate with Google SSO. See the [Google SSO documentation](/web-app/google-sso-domain-restriction) for setup details.

## Okta SSO (Enterprise)

We now support Okta SSO for Enterprise customers, a frequently requested feature for enterprise security requirements. You can enable Okta SSO via team settings under the new "Settings & Privacy" tab. We also extended this feature to support multiple domains for organizations with complex Okta tenant configurations. See the [Okta SSO documentation](/web-app/okta-sso) for setup details.

## Usage Table (Enterprise)

A new Usage table is now available, containing records of metered App, API, and Connector events. Users can search, filter, and export these records for detailed usage analysis and cost tracking.

## Private Content by Default (Enterprise)

Enterprise customers can now control the default privacy mode for team content with three options:
- **Public by default** — Team members choose per content
- **Private by default** — New content defaults to private, can be made public individually
- **Private only** — All content forced private, external sharing disabled

This helps teams working with sensitive data ensure privacy is the default, making link sharing an explicit opt-in.

## Improvements

- **Export CSV downloads** — Improved CSV export experience for usage data
- **Folder filtering** — Filter by Dashboards or Queries inside folders
- **Embed fix** — Fixed an issue where embeds did not show username/avatar when the query belonged to a user
- **EVM Contract resubmission** — Resubmission actions (rename, upgrade, delete) now gated to paid team plans
- **Query editor UX** — Click the drag icon to expand the query editor (in addition to dragging)

## Databricks Support for Datashare

Datashare now supports Databricks, expanding our data warehouse integrations beyond Snowflake and BigQuery. Stream Dune's complete blockchain dataset directly into your Databricks environment. See the [Databricks documentation](/datashare/datashare-databricks) and read the [announcement blog post](https://dune.com/blog/expanding-dune-datashare-with-databricks).

## dbt Connector (Enterprise)

Enterprise customers can now use dbt for in-platform data transformations with incremental runs. Build production data pipelines, version control your models, and run transformations directly on Dune. See the [dbt Connector documentation](/api-reference/connectors/dbt/overview) and read the [announcement blog post](https://dune.com/blog/run-dbt-on-dune-your-crypto-data-warehouse).

## New Chain Support

Added support for [Initia](/data-catalog/initia/overview), [Kalshi](/data-catalog/kalshi/overview), [Story](/data-catalog/evm/story/overview), [Mezo](/data-catalog/evm/mezo/overview), and [Monad](/data-catalog/evm/monad/overview). Explore raw, decoded, and curated data for these new chains in the Data Catalog.

## Analytics API Improvements

We shipped multiple improvements to the Analytics API to support new use cases and improve developer experience. The new [API landing page](https://dune.com/apis) provides a unified view of all endpoints with quick curl/preview actions and documentation links. The usage overview now includes charts and copyable API keys.

Key updates include:
- **Increased max query result size** from 8GB to 32GB
- **New endpoints** for executing arbitrary SQL, pipeline executions, usage data, and dataset metadata
- **Restructured [API documentation](/api-reference/overview/introduction)** to be scannable for newcomers while keeping advanced details discoverable
- **Updated SDKs** to include all new endpoints
- **Deprecated `/v1/tables` endpoints** — moved to `/v1/uploads`. See the [Tables API documentation](/api-reference/tables/endpoint/overview) for migration details
