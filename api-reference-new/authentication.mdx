# Authentication

Secure your API access with proper key management.

## API Keys

All API requests require an API key passed in the `X-Dune-API-Key` header.

```bash
curl -H "X-Dune-API-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" https://api.dune.com/api/v1/...
```

## Getting an API Key

[TODO: Step-by-step for creating API key]

## Key Scopes

[TODO: Different permission levels if applicable]

## Security Best Practices

- Never commit API keys to source control
- Use environment variables
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use separate keys for development and production

## Rate Limits

See [Rate Limits](/api-reference/resources/rate-limits) for details.
