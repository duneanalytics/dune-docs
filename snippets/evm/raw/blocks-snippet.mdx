    <p>
      The <code>{blockchain}.blocks</code> table contains information about blocks in the {blockchain} blockchain. A block is a collection of transactions that are hashed and added to the blockchain. Each block contains a reference to the previous block, known as the parent hash, and a timestamp. The table contains information about each block, such as the block number, the block hash, the block size, the number of transactions, and the gas used.
