    <h2>Table Description</h2>
    <p>
      The <code>{blockchain}.transactions</code> table contains information about all transactions on the {blockchain} blockchain. Each row represents a single transaction and includes information such as block number, hash, timestamp, sender, recipient, value, gas, gas price, and more. Transactions are the fundamental unit of interaction with the {blockchain} blockchain. Transactions are created by users and are used to send value, deploy smart contracts, and interact with smart contracts.
    </p>
    <p>
    <Tip> 
      This is the raw version of this table. If the chain is a Fully Managed chain, decoded transaction calls will be available, see <a href={`/data-catalog/evm/${blockchain}/decoded/call-tables`}>call tables</a> section. If this is a Hosted chain, decoded call tables will not be available.
