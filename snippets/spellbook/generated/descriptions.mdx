  "labels.nft_smart_trader_roi_eth": "The model itself is fundamentally an ROI-based ranking of NFT traders. The ranking of ROI is based on “realized” ROI, which is defined as ((ETH Gained from sales of NFTs) / (ETH Spent on buying those NFTS)) - 1. This could have easily been calculated from nft.trades with one or two CTEs, but the length of the query was intended to cover many edge cases that would make a trader not as “smart”. The query makes some opinionated decisions about what kind of traders to be filtered out, namely I filter for wallets:\n\n1. that have sold at least 10 NFTs\n2. that have traded at least 3 different collections\n3. that have spent at least 1 ETH on all purchases\n4. have a positive overall ROI (including unsold NFTs based on floor price)\n\nThe first 2 filters are to make sure people didnt just get lucky on one or two trades and have had success with multiple collections. The third is the filter out extremely high ROIs from low absolute numbers. The last one is an interesting filter I came up with only after looking at the data. It seems like many addresses have a high “realized” ROI only because they haven’t sold many of the other NFTs they purchased that have dropped significantly in price. Therefore I used the floor prices (from a combination of reservoir and `nft_ethereum.collection_stats` (to get both on and off-chain floor data) to estimate their return on their unsold assets. This way we ensure that they at least have a breakeven return when including the unsold portion of their portfolio. \n\nFinally I ranked the remaining traders based on their “realized” ROI and added labels for the top 1st/2nd/3rd percentiles among them. I chose to only include the top 3% since including the top 10% would result in ~14,000 addresses which is not as useful of a group. The ~5k addresses in the top 3% are more than sufficient and is a more manageable number for someone looking to use this for further segmentation / analysis. \n\nThe shortcomings here are that there is no period of time included in the ROI calculation. A further improvement could be to annualize the returns and/or restrict the set of addresses to only those that have been trading for at least x number of weeks. I included columns that would make this possible in the intermediate CTEs used in the queries.",

  "contracts.contract_mapping": "Mapping of contracts to its creators and names on EVM chains. # Contract Mapping\n\nTable models are defined in [`macros/models/_sector/contracts`](/macros/models/_sector/contracts)\n\nThis repository contains all the source code for `contracts.contract_mapping` that you can use to join contract addresses on each chain to pull our mapped project names in the `contract_project` field.\n\nMappings are derived from either mapping the contract deployer address to a project name `contracts.contract_creator_address_list`, reading from Dune's decoded contracts or manually overriding when the creator is not deterministic (i.e. the deployer creates contracts for multiple projects). We also use `contracts.project_name_mappings` to consolidate variations in project names. You can find the dependency graph generated by dbt [here](https://spellbook-docs.dune.com/#!/model/model.spellbook.contracts_contract_mapping).\n\n## How to Use\n\nBelow is a simplified example of using contract mapping table to get apps creating most transactions in the last 24 hours.\n\n```sql\nselect\n  cm.contract_project\n  ,count(*) as num_txs\n  ,sum(t.l1_fee + t.gas_used * t.gas_price)/1e18 as eth_fees\nfrom optimism.transactions as t\njoin contracts.contract_mapping as cm\n  on t.to = cm.contract_address\n  AND cm.blockchain = 'optimism'\n  and not is_self_destruct\nwhere\n  t.block_time > now() - interval '24' hour\n  and t.success\ngroup by 1\norder by 2 desc\n```\n\n## How To Contribute\n\n1. Follow the format and add the creator address and contract project to `contracts_contract_creator_address_list.sql`\n2. If you want to enforce consistent project name mapping other than Dune's decoded contract one, then add the name mapping to `contracts_project_name_mappings.sql`\n3. Submit the pull request (PR) and feel free to tag [@MSilb7](https://github.com/MSilb7) or [@chuxinh](https://github.com/chuxinh) if there's any questions\n4. Once the PR is merged, check on Dune if your work is correctly reflected 🔴✨",
