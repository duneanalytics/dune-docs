Dune's operations largely rely on a credit system. This guide will explain the concept of credits, their consumption, and management.

### What are credits?
Credits are the key to accessing a wide range of functions on the Dune platform. Whether you're delving into writing queries or simply exploring dashboards, knowing how credits operate is crucial.

### Why are credits important?
All actions on Dune, from refreshing a dashboard to exporting data via the API, consume credits. It's vital for every user, viewer, or creator alike, to be mindful of their credit usage.

## Your Credit Allocation

No worries, every Dune user gets a monthly credit allowance. Here's how it works:

### 🎟️ Monthly Credit Allowance
- **Set Number of Credits:** Each month, your subscription plan provides a set allotment of credits.
- **Top-Up:** Run out of credits? Our "pay as you go" option lets you add more anytime, ensuring your work is always in flow.

### 🔄 Rollover Policy
- **Monthly Refresh:** Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle; they do not roll over to the next month.
- **Maximize Use:** Plan your activities to maximize the utility of your credits.

### 👥 Team Accounts
- **Collective Pool:** All team members draw from a shared pot of credits. Sync up to make the most of your resources.

### Estimating Credit Usage
Understanding how your activities on Dune consume credits can help you manage your resources more effectively:
- **Credit Estimates:** Always check for tooltips or on-screen indicators that provide real-time estimates of credit costs before you perform actions.
- **Active Monitoring:** Keep a regular tab on your credit usage through your settings dashboard to avoid surprises.

## Managing Your Credits

### Tracking Your Usage
Hover over the odometer icon in your navigation bar for a quick glance at your credits. Make sure you're looking at the right account context.

### Detailed Credit Information
Go to **Settings** → **Subscriptions** for a deeper dive into your credit usage and options.

### Handling Excess Usage
Exceeding your monthly allocation? Here's how to handle it:
1. Add a payment method to your account to use additional credits at a fee above your included limit.
2. Set a cap in the **limit extra credits** field to keep your spending in check.

### 📊 Export Credit Usage Data
Teams and users can export detailed credit usage metrics to analyze consumption patterns and optimize their Dune usage.

#### How to Export Usage Data
1. Navigate to your team's usage dashboard
2. Click the **"Export usage"** button  
3. Your team's last 30 days of usage data will be downloaded as a CSV file

#### Understanding the Exported Data
The exported CSV file contains comprehensive usage information with the following columns:

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| timestamp | The exact date and time when the credit was consumed |
| user_id | Unique identifier for the user who consumed the credits |
| user_name | Display name of the user |
| service | The Dune service that consumed credits (e.g., query execution, API calls) |
| record_type | Type of usage record |
| credit_cost | Number of credits consumed for this action |
| plan | Your team's current subscription plan |
| skipped_quota_enforcement | Indicates if quota limits were bypassed (true/false) |
| query_id | Unique identifier for queries (when applicable) |
| metadata | Additional contextual information about the usage |

#### Use Cases for Exported Data
The exported usage data enables teams to:

• **Track individual user consumption:** Identify which team members are using the most credits  
• **Analyze service usage patterns:** Understand which Dune services consume the most credits  
• **Budget planning:** Use historical data to forecast future credit needs  
• **Optimize queries:** Identify expensive queries using the query_id field  
• **Compliance and reporting:** Generate usage reports for internal auditing  
• **Cost allocation:** Distribute costs across different teams or projects based on actual usage  

#### Data Analysis Tips
• Import the CSV into spreadsheet software or data analysis tools  
• Create pivot tables to summarize usage by user, service, or time period  
• Use the timestamp field to analyze usage patterns over time  
• Filter by query_id to identify and optimize resource-intensive queries  
• Monitor the credit_cost column to track spending trends  

#### Important Notes
• The export includes the last 30 days of data  
• All timestamps are in UTC  
• Credit costs reflect your team's pricing plan at the time of usage  
• The metadata field may contain additional JSON-formatted information depending on the service
