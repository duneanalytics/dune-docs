## Getting Started

To start leveraging Dune's Datashare on Snowflake for your blockchain analytics needs, visit the Dune profile on the [Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZSVZMYSCO/Dune). You will find one listing for each blockchain, and a listing for our Cross Chain datasets. For each listing, you will see a only couple of tables available. These are sample datasets for testing and available under free trial. To access the full data catalog and start your subscription, please contact us via the contact form on our [enterprise page](https://dune.com/enterprise).

### Accessing the Data

Once you have subscribed to Dune's Datashare on Snowflake, you can access the data directly from your Snowflake account. The data is organized into schemas, with each schema representing a blockchain or a cross-chain dataset. You can query the data using SQL, and use the results to power your analytics and insights. 

### Data updates and availability

Currently the data is updated every 24 hours by default, for special cases we can disucss more frequent updates. We replicate the data to multiple regions to ensure low latency and high availability.

### Datatypes

The data we provide on the Snowflake Marketplace is the same data that powers our own analytics platform. However, since the data is in a different environment, there is a slight difference in the way we need to store the data. This affects what datatypes we use to store the data, since there is no native support for common blockchain data types in Snowflake. This affects the way we store addresses, hashes, call data and other varbinary data. Furthermore, high-precisions integers like `uint256` and `int256` are also affected.

#### Varbinary data

For columns which have the datatype `varbinary` in Dune, there are two columns in Snowflake named "column_name" and "column_name_hex" (e.g., hash and hash_hex). "Column_name" is of type `varbinary`, "column_name_hex" is of type `string` and contains the 0x-prefixed lower cased hex representation of the binary data for convenience. For complex queries, it is recommended to use the "column_name" column, as it is more efficient. Snowflake does not support storing `varbinary` data with a `0x` prefix, so we store the data as `varbinary` and provide a `string` column with the hex representation for convenience. Queries using "hash_hex" will be much slower than queries using "hash" due to the datatype.


|Database | Column Name | Data Type         | Data Display Sample                                                            |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Dune        | hash        | `varbinary`    | 0xefb2e2c26974f72d9f3f04c693db73ecc679dd60   |
|Snowflake   | hash        | `varbinary`    | EFB2E2C26974F72D9F3F04C693DB73ECC679DD60  |
|Snowflake   | hash_hex    | `string`       | '0xEfB2E2c26974F72D9f3f04C693DB73eCc679dd60' |


```sql
--Using hash:
select * from ethereum.transactions where hash = X'efb2e2c26974f72d9f3f04c693db73ecc679dd60'
--Using hash_hex:
select * from ethereum.transactions where hash_hex = LOWER('0xEfB2E2c26974F72D9f3f04C693DB73eCc679dd60') -- Not recommended
```

<Info> Varbinary data in snowflake is displayed as `ABCDEF` but needs to be queried via `X'abcdef'`. There is a delta between the representation and the actual data. </Info>


#### High Precision Integers

For most columns with type `INT256` or `UINT256` in Dune, there are two columns in Snowflake, one of type `DOUBLE`, and one of type `VARBINARY`. The `VARBINARY` column contains the 32 byte, big-endian, 2s complement representation of the INT256 or UINT256 number. The DOUBLE column is named "column_name" while the `VARBINARY` column is usually named "column_name_binary" or "column_name_raw". For most use cases, the `DOUBLE` column is sufficient, but for queries that require exact precision it is recommended to use the Dune query engine, as it has native support for these data types. 

The `VARBINARY` datatype columns are useful when exact precision is needed, but calculations are not required. For example, if you want to join on `token_id` for erc1155 transfers, you can use the `VARBINARY` column `token_id_binary`. Using double for this would not work, as the precision is not sufficient.
