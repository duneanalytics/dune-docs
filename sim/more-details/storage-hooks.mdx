# Simple variables and mapping values

To hook on a variable, you provide its name/path as defined in source code. For example, for [Wrapped Ether](https://www.evm.codes/contract?address=0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2), you could hook on `balanceOf` or `allowance` (or `name`, `symbol`, `decimals`, but they won't be very interesting!).

If you want to track a specific value within a mapping, hook on the mapping and then filter on the key in the callback.

# Using slither to construct paths

For complex cases where variables are nested, you can used [slither-read-storage](https://github.com/crytic/slither/blob/master/slither/tools/read_storage/README.md) to generate the layouts and construct the paths required for storage hooks:

```bash
slither-read-storage 0x8ad599c3a0ff1de082011efddc58f1908eb6e6d8 --json storage_layout.json --etherscan-apikey *your etherscan api key*
```

Open `storage_layout.json`, which contains a description of each storage variable. Input the slither `name` field to the `Variable path` input on sim.

## Example 1: Simple variables

If the type doesn't involves a struct, all you need to do is provide us the top level variable names for instance `liquidity` or `feeGrowthGlobal0X128` in the case of `UniswapV3Pool`.

```json
{
    ...
    "liquidity": {
        "name": "liquidity",
        "type_string": "uint128",
        "slot": 4,
        "size": 128,
        "offset": 0,
        "value": null,
        "elems": {}
    },
    ...
      "feeGrowthGlobal0X128": {
        "name": "feeGrowthGlobal0X128",
        "type_string": "uint256",
        "slot": 1,
        "size": 256,
        "offset": 0,
        "value": null,
        "elems": {}
    },
    ...
}
```

## Example 2: Structs

In the case of structs, you need to give us the full path. `protocolFees` has two members, so you would need to define either `protocolFees.token0` or `protocolFees.token1`, depending on which variable you want to hook on.

```json
{
  ...
    "protocolFees": {
        "name": "protocolFees",
        "type_string": "UniswapV3Pool.ProtocolFees",
        "slot": 3,
        "size": 256,
        "offset": 0,
        "value": null,
        "elems": {
            "token0": {
                "name": "protocolFees.token0",
                "type_string": "uint128",
                "slot": 3,
                "size": 128,
                "offset": 0,
                "value": null,
                "elems": {}
            },
            "token1": {
                "name": "protocolFees.token1",
                "type_string": "uint128",
                "slot": 3,
                "size": 128,
                "offset": 128,
                "value": null,
                "elems": {}
            }
        }
    },
  ...
}
```

If you want to hook on both, add one storage hook for each.
