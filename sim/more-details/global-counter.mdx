# Why it exists

If `x` and `y` are two distinct *executions* that happened on the same blockchain, we want to be able to say that either `x` occurred before `y` or that `y` occurred before `x`. We want that for all `x` and `y`, i.e. a strong order, sometimes called a strict total order.

Note: You could use `block_number`, but that will fail if you have multiple records within a given block. You could use `(block_number, transaction_index)`, but that will fail if you have multiple records within the same transaction. Go down this rabbit hole far enough, and you'll rebuild your own version of our global counter!

# When should you use it

Two main use cases:

1. Sort a table with execution records by their order: order by `global_counter` (descending, if you want the most recent first).
2. Get state at a particular point in execution history (including current): find the execution records with the highest global counter up to that point in execution history.

# How to use it

Include `global_counter` as a `uint256` in your schemas. In your EVM lambdas, populate it with `simGlobalCounter()`. Note that the global counter is stable within each instance of a hook execution.

Apache Pinot still has limited math support for `big_decimal`. We're told this will be improved soon. In the meantime, if performing math on `global_counter` is failing for you, you may consider casting it to a double first (`cast(global_counter as double`), but note that this reduces precision and therefore can yield inaccurate event ordering.

# What it is

You probably shouldn't read this, but if you want the gory details... The `global_counter` is 192-bits long and consists of:

1. `version` (8 bits): the version of the global counter
2. `block_number` (32 bits)
3. `reorg_incarnation` (24 bits): Indicates how many re-orgs have happened already.
4. `block_epilogue` (8 bits): Consensus events that happen after the last transaction of the block. These might be present even if no transactions were included in a block. It is deliberately stored in bits which are higher than the `txn_index` to denote that events that have these bits set happened *after* any transaction in that block.
5. `txn_index` (24 bits)
6. `block_prologue` (8 bits): Consensus events that happen before the first transaction of the block
7. `txn_state` (8 bits): The phase we are in, relative to the transaction itself: before, within, epilogue, after
8. `txn_state_counter` (8 bits):  What event are we in, within the `txn_state`, i.e, bytecode execution
9. `shadow_pc` (40 bits): Only relevant if we are in bytecode execution phase. Represents the number of opcodes executed
10. `evt_counter` (16 bits) Extra event counter to distinguish between multiple events that we may emit as a result of the execution of the same opcode. One extreme example of it would be to emit an event every time a stack item pops off. This can definitely happen multiple times when executing the same opcode, although we've never actually came up with a good use case for this :).
11. `padding` (16 bits) Zeroes padding the counter to 192 bits. Our big-int library likes numbers that divide by 32.
