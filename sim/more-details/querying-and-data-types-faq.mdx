1. When should I use `uint256` versus downcast to `uint64`?
   1. When you emit a `uint256` to a persistence, it is ingested by Apache Pinot as `BIG_DECIMAL`. When you emit a `uint64`, it's ingested as `LONG`. In general, Pinot math functions support `LONG` better than `BIG_DECIMAL`. Often there are work-arounds for `BIG_DECIMAL`, e.g., using `sum_precision` instead of `sum`--reach out if you're stuck and we can help.
   2. Given the above, we recommend emitting data as `uint256` only when you need the precision. For balances, precision is crucial. For data like block numbers or timestamps, casting to `uint64` (i.e., `uint64(block.number)`) in the lambda and emitting as `uint64` in the schema might make your life easier if you later want to do `max(block_number)`.
2. What should I do about `numeric literal out of range` errors?
   1. This relates to Q1 above. Try a query like `select * from @sim.erc20_balance_changes_block where balance > 69803846217511559491961` and you'll run into `numeric literal out of range`. The simplest fix for this is to just pass the number as a string: `select * from @sim.erc20_balance_changes_block where balance > '69803846217511559491961'`. You can also use scientific notation: `select * from @sim.erc20_balance_changes_block where balance > 6.9e22`, but this comes with a lack of precision.
   2. Another situation where you might run into this is if you're using [Global counter](https://docs.sim.io/docs/global-counter) as a cursor for API [pagination](https://docs.sim.io/docs/api#pagination).
3. Is it better to use WHERE with a subquery or do an inner join?
   1. It depends--try both and look at the execution time at the bottom of the query editor! Here are some examples of what we're talking about. 
      ```sql WHERE with subquery
      -- DEMO PURPOSES ONLY, TABLES DON'T EXIST
      SELECT order_id, customer_id, order_total
      FROM Orders
      WHERE customer_id IN (
          SELECT customer_id
          FROM Customers
          WHERE customer_status = 'active'
      )
      ```
      ```sql Inner join
      -- DEMO PURPOSES ONLY, TABLES DON'T EXIST
      SELECT o.order_id, o.customer_id, o.order_total
      FROM Orders o
      INNER JOIN Customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
      WHERE c.customer_status = 'active'
      ```
4. Why is my query slow? Can I make it faster?
   1. It depends... Probably! Hit us on on Telegram--we're happy to help.
