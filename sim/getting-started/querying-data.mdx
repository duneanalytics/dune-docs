**Requirements:** You've already created your user account and an organization.

## Steps

1. From your org dashboard, open the query editor by hitting the `Queries` button.

2. Explore the query editor's three sidebars: `Tables`, `Queries`, and `Templates`.
   - The tables sidebar shows all persistences that belong to your organization as well as all `sim` core tables. If you open the query editor from a canvas that contains active persistence components, those tables will also be highlighted as Canvas tables.
   - The queries sidebar shows all of your queries. Queries are owned at the user-level, not at the org-level, so your collaborators won't see you queries unless you share with them.
   - The templates sidebar shows some common pre-built queries.

3. In the query editor, write a simple SQL query like `select * from @sim.blocks limit 10`. Then hit the Run button at the top right.

4. You can add parameters to a query using the `$` sign. Try replacing `limit 10` with `limit $limit` and then hit the run button again. This time it will ask you to define a type and value for the parameter. Parameters are helpful when you're running the same query frequently with different values and/or prototyping a query you intend to use in an API.

5. Try adding a new query with the `+` button.

## Basic query tips

<Tip>
Here are some helpful tips for writing effective queries in sim Studio:
</Tip>

1. It's SQL... We use Pinot's multistage engine. Pinot has [documentation](https://docs.pinot.apache.org/users/user-guide-query) available.

2. Always use a limit unless you know your result set is small. We help you with this with the `limit 100` checkbox.

3. Often the second time you run a query will be significantly faster than the first because the relevant data segments stay loaded in memory.

4. Filter with `where` early and often. Pinot has automatic indexing for all columns, so you should easily be able to filter on any column.

5. Addresses are stored as lower case strings. If you have a checksummed address, convert it to lower case, e.g., `where account_address = lower('0x48D004a6C175dB331E99BeAf64423b3098357Ae7')`.

You now know how to query existing tables. That'll only get you so far in life...
