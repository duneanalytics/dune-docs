# What is sim Studio?

sim Studio is a unified platform for blockchain data computation, storage, and serving/querying.

## What can I build?

We have prebuilt API templates and core tables that you can query and build upon and we will continue extending them. But with our flexible EVM lambdas for code insertion and configurable canvases, you can build just about any blockchain data pipeline that you can imagine with sim Studio. We built [evm.storage](https://evm.storage) with it. Obvious use cases include:

1. Indexing blockchain data
2. Building a dApp
3. Enriching transparency for a protocol
4. Monitoring and incident response

But pretty much any application and workload that can benefit from being synchronized to on-chain state and activity can benefit from sim.

You can see examples of each of these use cases at [sim.io](https://sim.io).

## What chains are supported?

For now: Ethereum, Arbitrum and Base (+Sepolia). Avalanche and Optimism are coming soon and we'll continue to add more in the future, if not having a specific chain is a reason you don't use sim, do reach out to us.

## How much does it cost?

We're still working out the details for paid tiers with additional features. But sim has a rich free tier (no credit card needed) with some restrictions on backfill and API quotas, if you happen to hit these limits do reach out. Our infra is efficient and scales well, so our pricing will be competitive and we aim to offer much higher value compared to other vendors or building pipelines yourself.

<Note>
If you have a project you are excited about and cost is a factor, do reach out to us.

## How much technical knowledge do I need?

With our API templates and core tables, you can build a production-ready API with no technical knowledge at all. But it's also extremely flexible: you can write your own queries and build APIs against our core tables with just simple SQL. When you're ready to generate your own blockchain data, dive into EVM lambdas. Our IDE generates and populates functional schemas for you, and we have many abstractions in hook context and simFunctions to make it easy to get the data you're looking for. You can also start by duplicating one of our example canvases. Even if you've never written *any* code before, it's very doable.

## What if I get stuck?

Join our [smlXL - sim Telegram group](https://t.me/+zw0fuNoYg39hZWRh) or email [shane@smlxl.io](mailto:shane@smlxl.io). Don't hesitate to reach out: if something's not working as you anticipate, or you can't work out how to do something, that's feedback that we really want. We're happy to help.
