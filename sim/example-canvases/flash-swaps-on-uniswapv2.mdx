title: Flash Swaps on Uniswap V2
description: Let's track flash swaps on Uniswap V2
---

## Goal

A regular Uniswap V2 swap involves an exchange of one token for another within a liquidity pool (LP). Uniswap V2 pioneered [flash swaps](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/guides/smart-contract-integration/using-flash-swaps), in which a user can withdraw as much as they want of any token in a liquidity pool instantly with zero upfront cost. By transaction end, the user must: 1) Return the withdrawn tokens themselves OR 2) Return an equivalent amount in other tokens. In either case, there's also an LP fee. If the conditions above are not met, the transaction fails, and the entire swap is reverted.

Flash swaps allow users of the protocol to create callbacks that will act upon initiating a swap via some `UniswapV2Pair` pool. These callbacks are predefined in contracts that implement the `IUniswapV2Callee` interface. In this example, we will create a canvas that tracks and provides data on flash swaps.

## Setting up the pipeline

### Adding components

1. Start by adding a *Data source* component. We want our pipeline to run at the tip, so we leave *To* blank and set *From* to the `UniswapV2Factory`'s deployment block (10000835). 

2. Add an *EVM Lambda* component and connect it to the right handle of the data source. For now, leave it as is. We'll come back to it in a bit.

3. Add a *Schema* and name it `uniswap_v2_flash_swaps`. Draw a connection from the lambda to the schema component and populate the schema with some important data we want to persist about each flash swap, as follows:

| Name                   | Type    |
| ---------------------- | ------- |
| txn\_hash              | bytes32 |
| block\_number          | uint64  |
| initiator              | address |
| uniswapV2Callee        | address |
| token0                 | address |
| token1                 | address |
| pair                   | address |
| is\_official\_v2\_pair | bool    |
| pair\_factory          | address |

4. Add a *Persistence* component and connect it to the *Schema* component. Save the schema and set the persistence.

5. Finally, add an *API* component that we will use to query the data in our table. Leave the query empty for now--we'll come back to it later.

You're all set! ðŸŽ‰

### Writing the code

We want to hook on all calls to the `uniswapV2Call(address,uint256,uint256,bytes)` function of all contracts. That means we need to target a specific ABI. For that we can use the `Input ABI Manually` option in our *EVM Lambda* component. This will hook on all contracts whose ABI include the inputted ABI. Let's input the JSON formatted ABI for our `IUniswapV2Callee` interface:

```json
[
    {
        "inputs":
        [
            {
                "internalType": "address",
                "name": "sender",
                "type": "address"
            },
            {
                "internalType": "uint256",
                "name": "amount0",
                "type": "uint256"
            },
            {
                "internalType": "uint256",
                "name": "amount1",
                "type": "uint256"
            },
            {
                "internalType": "bytes",
                "name": "data",
                "type": "bytes"
            }
        ],
        "name": "uniswapV2Call",
        "outputs":
        [],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
        "type": "function"
    }
]
```

Now we can add a *post* hook on the `uniswapV2Call` method and add a callback:

```solidity
function handleFlashSwap() public {
    handleFlashSwapContext storage ctx = getHandleFlashSwapContext();
    address token0 = IUniswapV2Pair(ctx.txn.from()).token0(); // fetch the address of token0
    address token1 = IUniswapV2Pair(ctx.txn.from()).token1(); // fetch the address of token1
    address factory = IUniswapV2Pair(ctx.txn.from()).factory(); // fetch the factory of the pair
    simEmitToSchema_uniswap_v2_flash_swaps(
        SchemaUniswap_v2_flash_swapsColumns({
            txn_hash: ctx.txn.hash(),
            block_number: uint64(block.number),
            initiator: ctx.inputs.sender,
            uniswapV2Callee: ctx.txn.to(),
            token0: token0,
            token1: token1,
            pair: ctx.txn.from(),
            is_official_v2_pair: ctx.txn.from() == IUniswapV2Factory(FACTORY_V2).getPair(token0, token1),
            pair_factory: factory
        })
    );
}
```

<Note>
Note that we want to verify if the call made was initiated by an official `UniswapV2Pair` contract. For that, we call the `UniswapV2Factory` and verify that the contract calling the callee is indeed the pair for `token0` and `token1`, as registered in the factory.

### Execution

You can test the execution within the code editor using the range `19000000` to `19000010`. You should see some results. Then we hit the play button on the execution edge to launch the full tip and backfill jobs.

### Setting up the API

If we want to do some analysis, we could open the query editor and write many SQL queries against our created data. But let's just go ahead and build an API that will serve the data for the N most recent flash swaps for a given LP. Go to the *API* component and input the following query:

```sql
select * from @org.uniswap_v2_flash_swaps
where pair = $pool
order by block_number desc
limit $limit
```

The pool parameter should be set to `address` and the limit should be set to `uint32`. If you want, you could specify default values of `0xf848e97469538830b0b147152524184a255b9106` and `1` respectively. Then test and set the API, and it's ready to be used.

## Key takeaways

<Tip>
1. Targeting custom ABIs is useful when we want to target a specific family of contracts that only have a limited set of functions/logs in common (such as `IUniswapV2Callee` contracts). sim makes this easy!
2. Making calls to arbitrary contracts from within sim callbacks is easy and allows us to compute anything we need to persist.
