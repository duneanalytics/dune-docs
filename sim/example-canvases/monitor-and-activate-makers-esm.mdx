title: Monitor and Activate Maker's ESM
description: We build a canvas that can be used to automatically shutdown Maker during a crisis
---

## Goal

Maker is a popular lending protocol that allows its governance token's ([MKR](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/mkr-module)) holders to decide when it is unsafe for the protocol to operate and, if necessary, shutdown all of its modules.

In order to shutdown the protocol, Maker deployed an [Emergency Shutdown Module (ESM)](https://docs.makerdao.com/smart-contract-modules/shutdown/emergency-shutdown-module). Holders of MKR can deposit their tokens at any time. Once the amount of deposited tokens reaches a threshold, the emergency kill-switch can be used by any caller to the contract's `fire()` method. It shuts down all Maker contracts. 

In this example, we show how we can monitor the amount of deposited tokens and send reports via a webhook to a server that will automatically call `fire()` when the threshold is reached.

If you want to skip to the end, here's [the canvas](https://studio.sim.io/canvases/828f9285-0bab-47bf-bd7d-ca4f9580abf3) that already has everything built:

## Before you start

<Warning>
You need a place to run your server that receives the webhooks and calls `fire()` if necessary. We are using [Heroku](https://heroku.com), but you can use any provider that can receive webhooks.
</Warning>

## Setting up the pipeline

### Adding components

1. Start by adding a *Data source* component. We want our pipeline to run at the tip, so we leave *To* blank and set *From* to the ESM's deployment block (14125857). 

2. Add an *EVM Lambda* component and connect it to the right handle of the data source. For now, leave it as is. We'll come back to it in a bit.

3. Then we add a *Schema* with the data we need for our webhook. Let's call it `sum_reached`. We want our webhook to receive reports for every change in `Sum`(the amount of deposited MKR tokens) and we only want the webhook to call `fire()` when `Sum > min`. Draw a connection from the lambda to the schema component and populate the schema as follows:

| Name               | Type    |
| ------------------ | ------- |
| sum                | uint256 |
| threshold\_reached | bool    |

4. Finally we add a *Webhook* component. Point it to the server instance you have running and set a rate limit if you want. Then connect the schema to the webhook component.

You're all set! ðŸŽ‰

### Writing the code

We want to hook on all changes to `Sum`.

1. Select `Address` for hook type and put the ESM address (`0x09e05ff6142f2f9de8b6b65855a1d56b6cfe4c58`) in the input. We'll use this [evm.storage](https://evm.storage/eth/19724666/0x09e05ff6142f2f9de8b6b65855a1d56b6cfe4c58/Sum#map) link to hook on just (post) on the `Sum` variable.

2. In the callback, we simply call the `min()` function to get the threshold and emit a message to the `Schema` we created before. We could emit this message only in cases where the threshold is reached, but here we're emitting it in either case along with a flag representing whether the threshold is reached.

```solidity
function handleSumChange() public {
    handleSumChangeContext storage ctx = getHandleSumChangeContext();
    if (ctx.valueAfter >= IESM(ctx.txn.codeAddress).min()) {
        simEmitToSchema_sum_reached(
            ctx.valueAfter, // sum
            true // reached
        );
    } else {
        simEmitToSchema_sum_reached(
            ctx.valueAfter, // sum
            false // reached
        );
    }
}
```

## A server to handle the webhooks

When a webhook message reaches the server, we need to inspect the data and decide if we call `fire()` or not.

1. We have a flask server running waiting for a request, we then post a transaction on-chain to the ESM contract if necessary. Here's the code:

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from web3 import Web3

app = Flask(__name__)

# Configure your Ethereum node provider
# For example, using Infura:
web3 = Web3(Web3.HTTPProvider('https://mainnet.infura.io/v3/YOUR_INFURA_PROJECT_ID'))

# The address that will send the transactions
from_address = web3.toChecksumAddress('your-wallet-address')
private_key = 'your-private-key'

# ABI and address for the smart contract
contract_address = web3.toChecksumAddress('contract-address')
# We can use a partial ABI that contains only the `fire()` function.
contract_abi = json.loads('[{"inputs":[],"name":"fire","outputs":[],"stateMutability":"nonpayable","type":"function"}]')
contract = web3.eth.contract(address=contract_address, abi=contract_abi)

@app.route('/webhook', methods=['POST'])
def webhook():
    data = request.json
    if data['threshold_reached']:
      nonce = web3.eth.getTransactionCount(from_address)
      txn_dict = contract.functions.fire().buildTransaction({
          'chainId': 1,  # Mainnet chain ID
          'gas': 2000000,
          'gasPrice': web3.toWei('50', 'gwei'),
          'nonce': nonce,
      })
      # Sign the transaction
      signed_txn = web3.eth.account.signTransaction(txn_dict, private_key=private_key)
      # Send the transaction
      txn_receipt = web3.eth.sendRawTransaction(signed_txn.rawTransaction)
      txn_hash = web3.toHex(txn_receipt)

    return jsonify({'transaction_hash': txn_hash}), 200
```

## Key takeaways

<Tip>
1. Monitoring your protocol's contracts' state becomes an easy task when using sim's powerful storage hooks.
2. You can use webhooks in order to send on-chain transactions and respond to events that happen in your protocol (liquidity of pools, balance of accounts, state variable changes, etc.)
