title: PartyDAO Crowdfund Statuses
description: We create one leaderboard of PartyDAO Crowdfunds and another of contributors within a crowdfund
---

## Goal

Party is a protocol that allows users to start a "crowdfund," a group that collaborates and contributes (Ether) in order to achieve a certain goal, such as buying an NFT.

Anyone can join a crowdfund by contributing Ether to the contract so long as the maximum amount allowed to be contributed to the fund hasn't been reached yet. Once the minimum amount contributed has been reached, the owner of the fund can execute the purpose of that fund, i.e., starting an ERC20 token or buying an NFT.

In the following example, we build one API that gives us a leaderboard of contributors for a specific crowdfund as well as another API that gives us a leaderboard of crowdfunds, ordered by total contributions.

If you want to skip to the end, here's [the canvas](https://studio.sim.io/canvases/2025e571-f58e-464a-a6fc-2b120e96b91c) that already has everything built.

## Set up the Lambda

1. Add an EVM Lambda to the canvas. Under *Hook type* select *ABI* and the input via address: `0xbda25a6e707be3887ee83e92203a5f6fbcc7775a`. This is an InitialETHCrowdfund contract. Since we're using the ABI hook, we're hooking on all contracts that implement this interface. Select the `Contributed` log hook and add it as a *Post* hook with a callback named `handleContribution`. Toggle on the `Generate schema` feature as it'll give us a good template.

2. A schema will be automatically generated. Click the menu next to the schema and select `Edit`. Add these additional fields to the auto-generated schema:

   | Name                 | Type    |
   | -------------------- | ------- |
   | global\_counter      | uint256 |
   | block\_number        | uint64  |
   | crowdfund            | address |
   | party\_name          | string  |
   | contributor          | address |
   | amount               | uint256 |
   | min\_required        | uint256 |
   | max\_required        | uint256 |
   | total\_contributions | uint256 |
   | passed\_min          | bool    |

3. Open the *Interfaces* sidebar and input the address for an InitialETHCrowdfund contract (`0xbda25a6e707be3887ee83e92203a5f6fbcc7775a`) and search. Once you've done this, you'll see the added interface both in the sidebar and the *Interface code* tab within the code editor. Rename the interface by replacing `I0xbda25a6e707be3887ee83e92203a5f6fbcc7775a` with `IInitialETHCrowdfund`.

4. When you're done editing the schema, hit `Save`. Now we need to write our Lambda code:

```solidity
contract UserProbe is BaseDeclarativeProbe {
    function handleContribution() public {
        handleContributionContext storage ctx = getHandleContributionContext();
        address cfProxy = simLogAddress();
        uint96 min_req = IInitialETHCrowdfund(cfProxy).minTotalContributions();
        uint96 max_req = IInitialETHCrowdfund(cfProxy).maxTotalContributions();
        uint96 total_contributions = IInitialETHCrowdfund(cfProxy).totalContributions();
        address party = IInitialETHCrowdfund(cfProxy).party();
        string memory party_name = IParty(party).name();
        
        simEmitToSchema_crowdfund_contributions(SchemaCrowdfund_contributionsColumns({
            global_counter: simGlobalCounter(),
            block_number: uint64(block.number),
            crowdfund: cfProxy,
            party_name: party_name,
            contributor: ctx.contributor,
            amount: ctx.amount,
            min_required: min_req,
            max_required: max_req,
            total_contributions: total_contributions + ctx.amount,
            passed_min: total_contributions + ctx.amount >= min_req
        }));
    }
}
```

<Warning>
Three important notes:

1. We use the `simGlobalCounter` to emit a unique identifier for each contribution event. Read more about it [here](/sim/more-details/global-counter)!

2. Since Crowdfund contracts are proxies deployed by the factory and pointing to the same implementation contract, we use the `simLogAddress` function to get the address of the proxy itself to get proper values for the methods we call on the crowdfund contract.

3. When targeting contracts by address, just like we did here, we get an automatically generated interface that is named after the address we've targeted. It can be renamed in the `Interfaces` tab for convenience to any name you find fit - in our case we've renamed it after the interface of the contracts we're targeting - `IInitialETHCrowdfund`.
</Warning>

4. Test your code with the *Test* button at the top-right of the IDE. You can use the range `17487000` to `17487010`. You should see one result as there was a single contribution in this range.

## Build the pipeline

1. Close the IDE. Click on the left handle of the Lambda component to add a `Data source`. Set *From* to 17480068, as this is when the Crowdfund Factory was deployed on Ethereum. Leave the *To* block blank as we'll let our code catch up to the tip and then continue to execute.

2. Click on the right handle of the Schema component to add a `Persistence`. Name the persistence `crowdfund_contributions` and set it.

3. Hit the play button on the execution edge. The code will start executing at the tip and backfilling from the *From* block. You can see its status by mousing over the `(?)`.

## Setting up the APIs

If we want to do some analysis, we could open the query editor and write many SQL queries against our created data. But let's just go ahead and build some APIs. 

1. Add an API component to the canvas. It doesn't have to be connected to any other components. For the first API, let's do a simple one that shows the top N contributors for a specific crowdfund:

```sql
select contributor,
sum(cast(amount as double)) as contributions 
from @org.crowdfund_contributions
where crowdfund = $crowdfund
group by contributor
order by contributions desc
limit $limit
```

2. For the `crowdfund` and `limit` parameters, use `address` and  `uint32`, respectively. Default values are optional, but `0xa3bad5098f9489f536342ca9957bbc808d9d5d96` and `10` make sense. Test the API and activate it.

3. For the second API, we want to get the top crowdfunds by total\_contributions. You can use the same type and default value for the limit parameter as above:

```sql
with latest_gc as (
  select crowdfund,
    max(cast(global_counter as double)) as latest_gc
  from @org.crowdfund_contributions
  group by crowdfund
)
select b.crowdfund, b.party_name, b.block_number, b.min_required, b.max_required, b.total_contributions,
  ((1.0 * b.total_contributions) * 100 / (1.0 * b.min_required)) AS pct_of_min,
  ((1.0 * b.total_contributions) * 100 / (1.0 * b.max_required)) AS pct_of_max,
  passed_min
  from @org.crowdfund_contributions b
  inner join latest_gc lgc on b.crowdfund = lgc.crowdfund and b.global_counter = lgc.latest_gc
order by total_contributions desc
limit $limit
```

Give them a try using the test interactions and the cURL requests! Note that this setup also easily supports time-travel, i.e., you can get the contributor leaderboard or crowdfund leaderboard at any point in time by including `where block_number <= [some_block_number]` in the queries. You could also make the block number a parameter to support time-traveling in the API request.

## Key takeaways

<Tip>
1. sim's unique [Global Counter](/sim/more-details/global-counter) allows us to order emitted messages, even within the same internal transaction!
2. sim's `Input ABI via address` makes it a breeze to target all contracts implementing the same interface.
3. We can create as many APIs as we want and point them to the same table.
