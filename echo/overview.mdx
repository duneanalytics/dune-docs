Dune Echo makes building multi-chain application seamless. We've worked hard to offer incredible multichain support (30+ networks in a single call)
with one of the industry's lowest latencies. These APIs power several of the best teams building on crypto.

## Available APIs:

### EVM

1. [Token Balances](./evm/balances): Access accurate and fast real time balances of native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on EVM blockchains.
2. [Transactions](./evm/transactions): Access transactions for accounts in real time across EVM blockchains.

### SVM

<Note>
These endpoints are currently in beta.
</Note>

1. [Token Balances](./svm/balances): Access accurate and fast real time balances of native, SPL and SPL-2022 tokens of accounts on SVM blockchains.
2. [Transactions](./svm/transactions): Access transactions for accounts in real time across SVM blockchains.

## Getting started
In order to get started, all you need is a Dune API key. See [here](/api-reference/overview/authentication#generate-an-api-key) how to generate one.
The API key should always be sent in the header `x-dune-api-key`.

## Pricing & Rate limits
All Dune users have access to Echo's free plan, irregardless of their account status on Dune. By default, all users are limited to 10 requests per second.
If you need a higher request rate, please get in touch by DMing [mewwts](https://x.com/mewwts).

We offer custom plans with high rate limits and monthly request quotas, and can easily support thousands of RPS and millions of monthly requests.

### React hooks

Do you have a React app that needs token balances or transaction data?
Get started by using the `useTokenBalances` and `useTransactions` React hooks from our [@duneanalytics/hooks](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@duneanalytics/hooks) package.
