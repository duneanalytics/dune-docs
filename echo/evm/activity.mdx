The Activity endpoint provides a real-time feed of on-chain activity for any EVM address. Activity is returned in chronological order (newest first) and includes:
- Native token transfers
- ERC20 token transfers with metadata (symbol, decimals)
- ERC721 (NFT) transfers with token IDs
- Contract interactions with decoded function calls

# Ordering

Activities are ordered by block time (descending) and then by transaction index within each block, so that newer activities appear first.

# Pagination

This endpoint uses cursor-based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is included in the initial response and can be utilized to fetch the next page of results by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.</Warning>
