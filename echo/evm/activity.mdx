<Note>
This endpoint is currently in beta and requires authentication using a normal Dune API key.
</Note>

The Activity endpoint provides a real-time feed of on-chain activity for any EVM address. Activity is returned in chronological order (newest first) and includes:
- Native token transfers
- ERC20 token transfers with metadata (symbol, decimals)
- ERC721 (NFT) transfers with token IDs
- Contract interactions with decoded function calls

# Response Fields

| Field | Description | Type |

## Activity Item Fields

| Field | Description | Type |
|--------|-------------|------|
| chain_id | ID of the blockchain where activity occurred | integer |
| block_number | Block number where activity occurred | integer |

| type | Activity type: 'transfer', 'call', or 'mint' | string |
| asset_type | Asset type: 'native', 'erc20', or 'erc721' | string |
| token_address | Contract address of token (for ERC20/ERC721) | string |
| from | Address initiating the activity | string |
| to | Recipient address | string |
| value | Amount transferred (in WEI) or contract call value | string |
| id | Token ID (for ERC721 transfers) | string |
| metadata | Additional context about the activity | object |

# Ordering

Activities are ordered by block time (descending) and then by transaction index within each block, so that newer activities appear first.

# Pagination

This endpoint uses cursor-based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is included in the initial response and can be utilized to fetch the next page of results by passing it as the `offset` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.</Warning>
