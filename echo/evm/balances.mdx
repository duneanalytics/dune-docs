title: 'Token Balances'
openapi: 'GET /echo/v1/balances/evm/{address}'
---

The Token Balances API provides accurate and fast real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on supported EVM blockchains.
Data is typically available within 100 ms since a block was propagated to nodes. The endpoint only returns balances for certain low latency chains by default.
To fetch balances for all supported chains please pass the `chain_ids=all` parameter. See [EVM Supported Chains](./balance-chains) for more details.

<Note>
  - These endpoints are authenticated with a normal Dune API key.
  - Specify `?filters=erc20` or `?filters=native` to get only erc20 tokens or native assets, respectively
  - Specify `?exclude_spam_tokens` to filter out tokens Dune believes to be spam. 
  - Specify `?chain_ids=all` to fetch balances for all supported chains.
  - Specify `?chain_ids=11,250,1` to fetch balances only for select chains. 
  - Specify `?metadata=url,logo` to get url and logo for tokens.
  - Token metadata, such as symbols and decimals, are gathered onchain.

# Token prices
Echo looks up prices onchain. We use the most liquid onchain pair to determine a usd price. We return the available liquidity in `pool_size` as part of the response, and show a warning `low_liquidity:	true` if this value is less than $10k.

# Spam tokens
By default the API filters out any token with `symbol = ''`, `symbol.length > 15`, `name = ''` or `decimals = 0`.
When the `?exclude_spam_tokens` is specified we use [this query](https://dune.com/queries/3804603) to determine if something is spam. Additionally, we remove any token with less than $100 of onchain liquidity.

# Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is passed back by the initial response and can be used to fetch the next page of results, by passing it as the `offet` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.</Warning>
