title: 'Token Balances (Beta)'
openapi: 'GET /echo/beta/balances/svm/{address}'
---

The Token Balances API provides accurate and fast real time balances of the native, SPL and SPL-2022 tokens of accounts on supported SVM blockchains.
Data is typically available within 100 ms since a block was propagated to nodes. We currently support Solana and Eclipse.

<Note>
  - These endpoints are authenticated with a normal Dune API key.
  - As we are in beta there might be changes. Please reach out to us using [this form](https://forms.gle/8qmnUZ6ZwzRFC2VY6) if you use this API.
  - Specify `?chains=all` to fetch balances for all supported chains.
  - Specify `?chains=solana,eclipse` to fetch balances only for select chains.
  - Birdeye is used for price information
  - Token metadata, such as symbols and decimals, are fetched from Birdeye using Jupiter's list of verified tokens.

# Pagination

This endpoint is using cursor based pagination. You can use the `limit` parameter to define the maximum page size.
Results might at times be less than the maximum page size.
The `next_offset` value is passed back by the initial response and can be used to fetch the next page of results, by passing it as the `offet` query parameter in the next request.

<Warning>You can only use the value from `next_offset` to set the `offset` parameter of the next page of results. Using your own `offset` value will not have any effect.</Warning>
