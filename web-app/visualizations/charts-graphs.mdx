**Visualizations make your data come to life! You can create Visualizations from any results of a query.**

On Dune you can create a variety of different graphs and charts to visualize your data.

</Accordion>


You can mix all of these graph types in one Visualization, as long as your base graph isn't a Pie chart.

All graph Visualizations share a common set of editing options, see the tabs below for how to configure each.

![all visualization configuration options](/web-app/images/charts-graphs/all-visualization-configuration-options.png)

## Visualization Configuration Options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Chart options">

    This section allows you to define how to display your data.

    ![see explanations below](/web-app/images/charts-graphs/graphs-4.png)

    **Title**

    * The title will appear in all instances of this graph prominently at the top.
    * The graph will always keep the name of the Query, even if you edit this.

    **Show chart legend**

    * Ticking this box will enable or disable the legend for the chart.

    **Enable stacking**

    * If applicable, ticking this box will stack the chart values on top of each other based on the x-axis values.
    * If this is not turned on, the values will be plotted individually on the y-axis.
    * The calculation underpinning this will always group the value corresponding to one value on the x-axis. Make sure your data is clean in order for this to work (avoid gaps in your data).

    **Normalize to percentage data**

    * This will normalize the chart to display percentage values of the chosen data table.
    * The calculation underpinning this will always group the value corresponding to one value on the x-axis. Make sure your data is clean in order for this to work (avoid gaps in your data).

    **Show data labels**

    * Ticking this box leads to the display of the individual datapoints inside of the graph.
    * This only makes sense in cases where you have few datapoints that are spread out far enough from each other to not overlap.

  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Result data">
    Here you can pick the data points that are to be displayed.

    ![see explanations below](web-app/images/charts-graphs/graphs-5.png)

    You can choose one **x-axis** and multiple **y-axis.**

    Alternatively, you can also choose one data series on the y-axis and choose to group it by a different column of your table (as shown in the example above).
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="X-axis options">

    Using these options you can influence how your x-axis data gets displayed.

    ![see explanations below](web-app/images/charts-graphs/graphs-6.png)

    **Axis title**

    * This field allows you to specify a title for your x-axis.

    **Sort Values**

    * By ticking this box you can specify if you want the values in your chart to be ordered.
    * If your x-axis is a time series, this will automatically happen.

    **Reverse value**

    * Ticking this box will reverse the order of the values on the x-axis.

    **Logarithmic**

    * Ticking this box will make your x-axis values display logarithmically.
  </Tab>
    <Tab title="Y-axis options">

    With these options you can influence how your y-axis data gets displayed.

    ![see explanations below](web-app/images/charts-graphs/graphs-7.png)

    **Axis title**

    * This field allows you to specify a title for your y-axis.

    **Logarithmic**

    * Ticking this box will make your x-axis values display logarithmically.

    **Enable right y-axis**

    * Ticking this box will enable an additional y-axis that you can plot values on.
    * You can choose in the [chart series section](web-app/visualizations/charts-graphs#ordering-your-series) what you want to be displayed on the left and right axis.
  </Tab>
    <Tab title="Series options">

    ![](web-app/images/charts-graphs/graphs-9.png)

    In this section of the Visualization editor you can finalize your graph.

    * You can rename the "series" by simply clicking into the field.
    * You can change the chart type by clicking into the dropdown.
    * You can change the colors by clicking into the color box.
    * Finally you can also change the order of the series.

    **Picking Colors**

    You can pick colors with your browser native color selector.

    This might look slightly different for you depending on which browser you use.

    ![Choose any color you want!](web-app/images/charts-graphs/graphs-color.gif)
  </Tab>
    <Tab title="Pie options">
    ![pie options](web-app/images/charts-graphs/pie-options.png)

    **Label format**

    * This field allows you to define the [tick format](#xy-axis-tick-and-label-formats) of the data labels in your pie chart.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### X/Y-axis Tick and Label formats

![image](/web-app/images/charts-graphs/graphs-8.png)

Tick formats change how numeric values and axis labels in your graphs are displayed.

Here's how to format them:

| Starting Value        | Tick/Label format | Output          | Description                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1256784.3745 | `[blank]`  | 1256784.3745000 | Displays the number with 7 decimal precision.                                                                                                                |
| 1256784.3745 | `0`           | 1256784         | Displays only the integer.                                                                                                                            |
| 1256784.3745 | `0,0`         | 1,256,784       | Only displays the integer with comma separation.                                                                                                      |
| 1256784.3745 | `0,0.00`      | 1,256,784.38    | Displays the number with `[x]` decimal precision, where `[x]` is the number of `0`s you add after the decimal point.                                                                |
| 1256784.3745 | `0.0a`     | 1.2M            | Displays the number with `[x]` precision and a letter based on the number's `1e[y]` power (eg "m" for million, "b" for billion)  |
| 1256784.3745 | `$0.0a`    | $1.2M           | Adds a "\$" to the number. Works with all formats above though use of the `a` suffix is recommended. Currently "\$" is the only supported currency symbol.                                                                                      |
