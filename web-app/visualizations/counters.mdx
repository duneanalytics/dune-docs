#### Counter options

In this section, you can define what kind of data the counter should display:

<Accordion title="Display Title" icon="title">
    * The Title will appear in all instances of this graph prominently at the top.
    * If left blank, the Query name will be the only thing that is left standing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Column Selection" icon="column">
    * In this field, you can define which column the counter should show.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Row Selection" icon="row">
    * This field can be used to define which row of the underlying data table you want displayed, e.g., row 1.
    * Usually, this requires you to sort or limit your Query results in order for row 1 to show the wanted results.
</Accordion>

#### Formatting

This section is where you can adjust how your numerical data is displayed.

<Accordion title="Prefix Setting" icon="prefix">
    * This field allows you to define a prefix for your counter value.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Suffix Setting" icon="suffix">
    * This field allows you to define a suffix for your counter value.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Label Setting" icon="label">
