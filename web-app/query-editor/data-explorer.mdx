The left sidebar of the query editor is the Data Explorer. It allows you to search for blockchain and other data to use in your queries.

You can learn about Dune's data tables [in the data tables section](/data-catalog).

## Browsing data

Here is a simple example of how to use the Data Explorer to find the data you need:

1. Click on one of the categories in the left sidebar to see the tables available in that category.
2. Filter the tables through the dropdowns in the top right corner.
3. Check out the table preview to see what data is available in that table.
4. Click on the arrow next to the table name to include it in your query.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(61.916666666666664% + 41px)",
    height: 0
  }}
>
  <iframe

    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Dune"
  />
</div>

## Finding specific tables

You can also search for specific tables in the Data Explorer.

1. Choose the "decoded projects" category.
2. Type the project's name in the search bar.
3. Choose the project you want to explore.
4. Type the smart contract name in the search bar.
5. Choose the smart contract you want to explore.

Note that we do not show tables for functions and events with no onchain data. Make sure your function or event has been called onchain before you try to query it.
If you're not seeing what you expect, please input your chain and contract address into [this query](https://dune.com/queries/5261232) and inspect the results.

You can also use the search bar to search by contract address, table name, or any other keyword.
