Dune can restrict **Google SSO join requests** so that only users with an email address on an approved domain can join your workspace.

## How the allowed domain is determined

The **allowed domain is automatically set to the email domain of the workspace admin** who enables the setting.

Example:

- If the admin enabling the setting has `admin@dune.com`, then the allowed domain will be `dune.com`.

## What this setting does

When enabled:

- Only users signing in with Google SSO using the **allowed domain** can join the workspace.
- Users attempting to join with a different email domain will be blocked.

This is useful to prevent personal Gmail accounts (or other unapproved domains) from joining your workspace.

## Before you enable this

> **Important** You must remove any existing workspace members whose email domain does **not** match the admin’s domain **before** enabling this setting.

Also note:

- While enabled, **users cannot change their email address** in Dune.
- Users who previously used **email/password** will be prompted to sign in using **Google SSO**.

## Enable Google SSO domain restriction

1. Go to **Settings → Security & Privacy → Google SSO domain restriction**.
3. Toggle **Restrict Google SSO to approved domain** on.
4. Confirm the **Allowed domain** shown matches the admin’s email domain.

Once enabled, Dune will display the allowed domain (for example: `dune.com`) in the setting.
