## What is Multichain Decoding?

Multichain Decoding enables seamless analysis of smart contract data across multiple blockchains. With a single contract submission, users can automatically generate protocol tables across all supported EVM chains, simplifying cross-chain data access on Dune.

This feature unifies contract data views, streamlining the analysis of protocols deployed across various chains and making cross-chain insights more accessible.

<Tip>Multichain decoding offers data freshness and latency comparable to regular decoding. For details on data freshness, see our [data freshness page](../../data-catalog/data-freshness).</Tip>

## Example Usage

Here are a few examples showing how you can use multichain decoded table views to simplify your analysis. Each example includes "before" and "after" queries to demonstrate how multichain views streamline cross-chain analytics.

## How It Works

### Requirements for Multichain View Construction ⚠️

To create a multichain decoded view, the following criteria must be met:
- Contracts must have the **same ABI** across chains.
- Contracts must be organized under the **same project namespace and contract name** (e.g., `uniswap_v3`, `UniswapV3Pool`).

This standardized labeling enables Dune to merge data from different chains into a single, unified view.

### Submitting Multichain Contracts

<Warning>
**Paid Team Required**: Only users with a paid team subscription can submit multichain contracts. Individual accounts and free teams do not have access to multichain contract submissions. For more information about team plans, see our [pricing page](https://dune.com/pricing).
</Warning>

      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Submit Multichain Contracts"
  />
</div>

When contracts with the same ABI are submitted across multiple chains, they are combined into a single cross-chain table, enabling consistent, streamlined data access and queries across chains.

### Accessing and Navigating Tables

Multichain decoded contract tables are accessible in the Data Explorer, just like regular decoded contract tables. These multichain entries feature a distinct symbol and display the list of supported chains, clearly indicating they span multiple chains.
