description: Configure SSO, restrict access by email domain, and manage authentication settings for your Dune workspace.
---

Dune supports SSO controls that help you restrict who can join your workspace and how members authenticate.

## Available controls

### Okta SSO (OIDC)
Use Okta SSO to require members to sign in with Okta. This includes:
- Verifying one or more email domains via DNS
- Configuring an Okta OIDC application
- Enforcing Okta sign-in for workspace members

👉 See: **Okta SSO setup** (`/security/okta-sso`)

### Google SSO domain restriction
Restrict **team join requests** via Google SSO to users with an approved email domain.

👉 See: **Google SSO domain restriction** (`/security/google-sso-domain-restriction`)

## Before you enable any restriction

> **Important**
> - If a restriction is enabled, **members with non-matching email domains may need to be removed** before enabling.
> - While enforced, **users can’t change their email** in Dune.
> - Users with email/password accounts will be prompted to sign in with the configured SSO provider.
