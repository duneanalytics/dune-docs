description: Mint Dashboards on Dune to Support Wizards
---

The best way to support wizards is to mint their dashboards on Dune. We've built an integration with Zora to mint any "moment" from a Dashboard. Mints cost 0.000777 ETH (roughly $2).

You can mint by going to any dashboard and clicking the blue "mint" button in the top right.

 **If you're a creator looking to enable minting on your dashboards, you must link your wallet to your Dune account [by going to account settings](https://dune.com/settings/wallets).**

## Minting a Moment

When you click mint, you'll see this modal popup. The key interactions are labeled below:

You'll have to connect your Ethereum wallet, if you don't have one yet you can install [Metamask](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/metamask/nkbihfbeogaeaoehlefnkodbefgpgknn?hl=en) and then fill it with ETH from Coinbase or some other onramp. **Minting occurs on Base, so make sure to [transfer your ETH to Base to mint](https://help.coinbase.com/en/coinbase/other-topics/other/base).**

After you select an amount and click mint, Dune will take a screenshot and create the token on Zora for you to mint. This may take 5-10 seconds, but you will then see a prompt in your wallet that looks like this:

This is showing you the number of tokens you will recieve, and how much ETH you are spending + gas fees. After you confirm, it should only take a second before you see a successful mint screen:

Congrats - you've now saved an onchain moment in an onchain momento forever! Thank you for supporting the community at Dune.

## Claiming Rewards as a Creator

If your dashboard gets minted, log into [zora.co/manage](https://zora.co/manage) with the wallet that is connected to the dashboard owner's dune account to claim your rewards.

Dune takes the creator referral fee, and the first minter of a given moment gets the first minter referral fee - [learn about Zora rewards structure here](https://support.zora.co/en/articles/2509953).

Each time someone mints off a dashboard, a unique token id is created on the Dune [zora collection on Base chain](https://basescan.org/address/0xdc6b3687d5d9ada19faad9e782e3ece41e1da7ba). The ipfs URI contains the details about the Dune dashboard and creator. Anyone can mint more of a specific moment (token id) by going to that tokens page on Zora, but we don't currently support minting other people's moments in the dune UI.
