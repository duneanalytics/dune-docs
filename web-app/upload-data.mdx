**Easily upload your own data to Dune**

This feature allows you to upload any csv file to Dune and query it like any other table in Dune. Currently, we only support uploading CSV files with a maximum size of 200 MB. The app will return an error if the file size exceeds this limit.   
Additionally, column names in the table can't start with a special character or digits.

The files you upload will be queryable via the schema ``dune.team_name.dataset_name``. For example, if you upload a file called ``energy_data.csv`` to the team ``dune`` and name the dataset ``energy_data``, you will be able to query the data via ``dune.dune.energy_data``.

You'll be able to query for your data in any query.

```sql
Select * from dune.dune.dataset_energy_data
```

<Note>
    All data uploaded is public and can be accessed by anyone.   
    Private data uploads are available only on the **premium plan.**
</Note>

<Tip>
    You can also upload data via the API. Check out the [API documentation](/api-reference/tables/endpoint/upload) for more information.

</div>

1. Click on the "Upload Data" button in the menu of the Dune UI.
2. Select the csv file you want to upload.
3. Name your table and add a description.
4. Click on save to finish the upload.


## Querying for the data in Dune

Once the data has been uploaded, you can explore it in the my data section in the data explorer: 

![upload data](web-app/images/upload_data.gif)

You can query for your data in any query.

```sql
Select * from dune.dune.dataset_energy_data
```

To check whether the datatypes are correctly inferred, you can check the table details in the [data explorer](/web-app/query-editor/data-explorer).

## Updating data

Updating data is only possible via the [API](/api-reference/quickstart/tables-eg). In the UI you can only replace the data with a new (updated) file that carries the same name.

However, you can use the "query a query" feature to query multiple .csv files at once.

**For example:**

```sql
--query_2441513

Select * from dune.dune.dataset_energy_data_1

UNION ALL

Select * from dune.dune.dataset_energy_data_2

-- add more as it becomes relevant
```

In your main query, you could then simply refer to this query.

```sql
Select * from ethereum.transactions t
left join query_2441513 q on q.address = t."from"
```

## Private data

If you don't want to share your data with the world, you can also upload private data. Private data is only visible to you and your team members.

To upload private data, **you need to be on the premium plan**. If you are on the premium plan, you can upload private data by toggling the "make table private" switch in the upload data modal.

You can also change the privacy settings of a dataset after it has been uploaded. To do so, go to settings -> data page and click on the three dots next to the dataset you want to change the privacy settings for. Then click on "make table private" to make the table private or "make table public" to make it public. 

## Deleting data

You can delete your data via your settings page.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(61.25000000000001% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
