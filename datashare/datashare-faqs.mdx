  <Accordion title="I'm interested in data that isn't available for the trial.">
    We can provide any of Dune's vast catalog on Snowflake. However, for testing Dune's data capabilities, we only have the pre-uploaded tables available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How often does the trial data get refreshed?">
    Currently the data is updated every 24 hours by default, for special cases we can disucss more frequent updates. We replicate the data to multiple regions to ensure low latency and high availability.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I clicked GET and did not see the popup window. What happened?">
    In some cases, Snowflake has to prep and duplicate the data to a local server before it can be downloaded and added to your Snowflake. In this case, Snowflake will either duplicate the data and then make it available to you, or send you an email when it is available for you to download.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does the trial run?">
    The trial period for each dataset (chain) runs for 30 days.
