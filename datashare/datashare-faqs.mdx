---
<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Datashare work technically?">
    **Snowflake**: Uses Snowflake's native data sharing - data stays in our account but appears as tables in yours. Zero storage costs, only compute charges.
    
    **BigQuery**: We replicate data to shared datasets in your GCP project. Data is copied to your region for performance.
    
    Both provide the same curated blockchain data that powers dune.com.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What identifiers do I need to share with Dune?">
    **Snowflake**: Account locator (e.g., `ABC12345.US-EAST-1`) - found in your Snowflake URL
    
    **BigQuery**: GCP Project ID and a Principal (your email, service account, or domain)
    
    We never need passwords or sensitive credentials - just sharing identifiers.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I get started?">
    **Snowflake**: Self-service via [Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZSVZMYSCO/Dune) for 30-day trial
    
    **BigQuery**: Email datashares-sales@dune.com with your GCP Project ID
    
    **Enterprise**: Visit [dune.com/enterprise](https://dune.com/enterprise)
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What platforms do you support?">
    - **Snowflake** (marketplace access, all regions)
    - **BigQuery** (custom setup, US Central 1 & EU West 2)

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How fresh is the data?">
    **Standard**: 24 hours for most tables
    **Enterprise**: Hourly updates available
    **Real-time**: Some key tables update every few minutes
    
    Freshness varies by chain and table type.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is it the same data as Dune's platform?">
    Yes, identical curated data. Data types are optimized for each platform:
    - BigQuery: Uses BIGNUMERIC for large integers, BYTES for addresses
    - Snowflake: Uses VARBINARY for addresses/hashes, DOUBLE for calculations
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I join with my existing data?">
    Yes - that's the main benefit! Query blockchain data alongside your internal datasets using your warehouse's native SQL.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you see my queries or data?">
    No. You query in your own warehouse environment. Dune cannot see your queries, results, or any data you join with ours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What does it cost?">
    **Trials**: Free (Snowflake 30 days, BigQuery by request)
    **Production**: Contact sales for pricing
    **Compute**: You pay your cloud provider's standard rates for querying
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="[Snowflake] Get button didn't work?">
    Click "Get" twice if needed. Snowflake sometimes requires:
    1. First click: Copies data to your region
    2. Second click: Adds share to your account
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="[BigQuery] How do I find shared datasets?">
    Shared datasets appear in your BigQuery console under your project. Look for datasets with names like `dune_ethereum` or `dune_polygon`.
