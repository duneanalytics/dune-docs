Dune's vast data catalog can make getting started with Datashare feel daunting. With this in mind, we have created flexible trial data on Snowflake that are available and easily accessibly by any Snowflake user. Follow the step-by-step setup guide below to begin!

## Finding the Trial Data

To access Dune's trial data, proceed with the following steps: 

<Warning>
  To access the trial data, you will need to have an account on Snowflake. Please create an account on Snowflake before following this guide.
</Warning>

1. Navigate to the "Data Provider" tab in the sidebar.
2. Type in "Dune" in the search bar. Dune's Snowflake profile should pop up under "Providers".

The process can be seen below. Note that Dune has tables on 17 chains available for trial. The specific tables available for each chain can be seen on the chain's landing page.

## Accessing the Trial Data

Once you've identified which chain(s) you'd like to add for your trial, you will take the following steps (note that you will need to repeat this process for each chain you want to add to your trial): 

1. Navigate to the "Get" button under "30 Days Free".
2. Click the "Get" button.
3. In the window that pops up, make sure that make sure that "Try for Free" is highlighted and select your preferred options.

<Tip>
When you click "Get" you will be provided with a few options.

**Database Name:** The prechosen name for the database is here. If you'd like to change the name of the database, you can do so in this box.

**Roles:** If you would like to limit access to this trial, you can choose which roles can access the data. 
</Tip>

4. Click "Get".

When the data is ready to use, the screen will show a popup. From there if you'd like to immediately start querying the data, you can select "Query Data". If you would like to navigate away from the page, you can always return to query the data by selecting "Open" on the chain's landing page.

<Warning>
 Note that due to Snowflake's setup, you may need to click the "Get" button twice. Once to copy the data to the local server, and again to actually "Get" the data. To be safe, it's always good to open the trial data from the landing page to make sure it was successfully added to your Snowflake.
</Warning>

Once you've confirmed that the data has successfully been added to your Snowflake as a database, you are free to be begin querying! You can add as many of the trial chains to your Snowflake as you'd like for 30 days.
