description: Access Dune's blockchain data through the Snowflake Marketplace
---

Access 1.5M+ blockchain tables across 50+ chains directly in your Snowflake environment.

## How It Works

Snowflake Datashare uses Snowflake's native data sharing capabilities to provide instant access to Dune's data:

- **Shared Storage**: Data lives in Dune's Snowflake account but appears as regular tables in your environment
- **Zero-Copy Sharing**: No data transfer fees or storage duplication - you only pay for compute
- **Live Updates**: Shared data automatically reflects our latest blockchain processing
- **Native Access**: Query using standard Snowflake SQL with full performance optimization

## Get Started

**Trial (Free):**
1. Go to [Dune on Snowflake Marketplace](https://app.snowflake.com/marketplace/providers/GZSVZMYSCO/Dune)
2. Click "Get" on any dataset for 30-day free trial
3. Start querying

**Production:** [Contact enterprise team](https://dune.com/enterprise) or email datashares-sales@dune.com

## Sharing Identifiers

Snowflake uses share identifiers for accessing shared datasets:

- **Marketplace shares**: Automatically managed when you click "Get" on marketplace
- **Direct shares**: For enterprise setups, you'll receive specific share names
- **Share format**: `<account_locator>.<share_name>` (e.g., `DUNEANALYTICS.ETHEREUM_SHARE`)

For direct share access, use:
```sql
-- List available shares
SHOW SHARES;
```

See [Snowflake's sharing documentation](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/data-share-consumers) for more details.

## Data Types

Blockchain data types are adapted for Snowflake:

### Addresses & Hashes
- `column_name` (VARBINARY) - use for queries (faster)
- `column_name_hex` (STRING) - for convenience

```sql
-- Recommended:
WHERE hash = X'efb2e2c26974f72d9f3f04c693db73ecc679dd60'
-- Slower:
WHERE hash_hex = '0xefb2e2c26974f72d9f3f04c693db73ecc679dd60'
```

### Large Integers (uint256/int256)
- `column_name` (DOUBLE) - for most calculations
- `column_name_binary` (VARBINARY) - for exact precision

Use VARBINARY for exact matching (e.g., token IDs), DOUBLE for calculations.

If you need full precision when doing arithmetic, you must work with the VARBINARY field:
• You can convert the binary to `DECIMAL(38,0)` if you are fine with the smaller range (up to 38 digits vs. 78 for `UINT256`).
• Any values larger than `DECIMAL(38,0)` will overflow and must be handled as `NULL` or excluded.

Here is an example conversion query:
```sql
select 
  IFF(
    SUBSTR(amount_raw, 1, 17) != TO_BINARY(REPEAT('0', 34), 'HEX'), -- check for overflow
    NULL, -- if overflow, return null
    TO_NUMBER(
      TO_VARCHAR(SUBSTR(amount_raw, 18, 15), 'HEX'),
      REPEAT('X', 30)
    )::NUMBER(38,0) -- convert last 15 bytes to decimal
  ) AS amount_raw_converted,
  amount_raw,
  amount,
  tx_hash
from prod_datashares.tokens.transfers
limit 100;
```
