description: Access all of Dune's blockchain data directly in your data warehouse for privacy and control.
---

Dune Datashare brings our complete blockchain dataset (1.5M+ tables, 50+ chains) directly into your data warehouse. Query blockchain data in your own environment with complete privacy and control.

## How Datashare Works

Datashare replicates Dune's processed blockchain data directly into your cloud data warehouse:

1. **Data Replication**: We maintain live copies of all Dune tables in your Snowflake or BigQuery environment
2. **Native Integration**: Data appears as regular tables/datasets in your warehouse - no APIs or external connections
3. **Fresh Data**: Automatic updates keep your data in sync with Dune's platform (hourly/daily refresh)
4. **Your Environment**: Query using your warehouse's native SQL, compute, and security controls

<Info>
This is the same curated, decoded blockchain data that powers dune.com - optimized for analytics with proper data types and indexing.

### What We Need From You

To set up datashare access, we need specific identifiers from your cloud environment:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Snowflake Requirements">
    **For Marketplace Access:**
    - Your Snowflake account locator (e.g., `ABC12345.us-east-1`)
    - Organization name (if using Snowsight)
    
    **For Direct Shares:**
    - Account locator: `<account_name>.<region>` 
    - Account name (the part before the dot in your Snowflake URL)
    - Cloud region (AWS, Azure, or GCP region)
    
    Example: If your URL is `https://abc12345.us-east-1.snowflakecomputing.com`, your account locator is `ABC12345.US-EAST-1`
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="BigQuery Requirements">
    **Required Information:**
    - **GCP Project ID** (not project name - the unique ID)
    - **Principal for access** (user email, service account, or domain)
    - **Preferred region** (US Central 1 or EU West 2)
    - **Chains of interest** (optional - we can share all by default)
    
    **Principal Examples:**
    - User: `user:alice@company.com`
    - Service Account: `serviceAccount:etl-service@my-project.iam.gserviceaccount.com`
    - Domain: `domain:company.com` (all users in domain)
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Setup Process

1. **Share Identifiers**: Provide the required identifiers for your platform
2. **Access Configuration**: We configure sharing permissions on our side
3. **Verification**: We'll confirm when data is available in your environment
4. **Support**: Ongoing technical support for queries and optimization

<Warning>
**Security Note**: We only need identifiers to grant access - never passwords, keys, or other sensitive credentials.
</Warning>
