title: Writing Efficient Queries
description: Get the most out of DuneSQL by writing efficient queries.
---

This guide provides practical do's and don'ts specifically tailored to DuneSQL and Dune's architecture, allowing you to optimize credit spend.

## Key Principles

Dune's query engine is optimized for blockchain data analysis with time-partitioned tables and columnar storage. 
Understanding the [DuneSQL architecture](/query-engine/dunesql-architecture) will help you write queries that execute faster and consume fewer resources.

## ✅ DO's: Query Optimization Best Practices

### 1. Leverage Time-Based Partitioning

Dune partitions most tables by `block_date` or by `block_time` 

Check on the data explorer (left-side panel) to see which fields are used as partitions.
Always include time filters to enable partition pruning.

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Filters by block_date to enable partition pruning
SELECT 
    hash,
    "from",
    "to",
    value
FROM base.transactions
WHERE block_time >= TIMESTAMP '2025-09-01 00:00:00'
  AND block_time < TIMESTAMP '2025-10-02 00:00:00'
  AND "to" = 0x827922686190790b37229fd06084350E74485b72
```

### 2. Select Only Required Columns

Specify only the columns you need. Dune's columnar storage makes this especially effective.

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Selects only necessary columns
SELECT 
    evt_block_time,
    "from",
    "to", 
    value
FROM erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer
WHERE contract_address = 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48
  AND evt_block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7' DAY
```

### 3. Use Efficient JOIN Strategies

Put time filters in the ON clause and join on indexed columns when possible.

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Efficient join with time filter in ON clause
SELECT 
    t.hash,
    t.block_time,
    l.topic0,
    l.data
FROM ethereum.transactions t
INNER JOIN ethereum.logs l 
    ON t.hash = l.tx_hash
    AND t.block_date >= TIMESTAMP '2024-10-01'
    AND t.block_date < TIMESTAMP '2024-10-02'
WHERE t."to" = 0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48
```

### 4. Use CTEs for Complex Logic

Break complex queries into readable Common Table Expressions.

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Using CTEs for better performance and readability
WITH daily_volumes AS (
    SELECT 
        DATE(block_time) as trade_date,
        SUM(amount_usd) as daily_volume
    FROM dex.trades
    WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
      AND block_month >= TIMESTAMP '2024-09-01'     
      AND block_month < TIMESTAMP '2024-10-01'
    GROUP BY DATE(block_time)
),
volume_metrics AS (
    SELECT 
        trade_date,
        daily_volume,
        AVG(daily_volume) OVER (
            ORDER BY trade_date 
            ROWS BETWEEN 6 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) as rolling_7day_avg
    FROM daily_volumes
)
SELECT * FROM volume_metrics
ORDER BY trade_date DESC
```

### 5. Use LIMIT with Large Result Sets

Always use LIMIT when you don't need all results, especially for exploratory queries.

```sql
-- ✅ GOOD: Using LIMIT for large result sets
SELECT 
    hash,
    block_time,
    gas_used,
    gas_price
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_time >= TIMESTAMP '2024-10-01'
ORDER BY gas_price DESC
LIMIT 1000
```

### Use Curated Data Tables

Leverage Dune's [curated tables](https://docs.dune.com/data-catalog/overview) which are pre-computed and optimized rather than use raw logs and traces.

## Query Performance Troubleshooting

- Monitor query execution time in the Dune interface
- Check the query plan for full table scans (run EXPLAIN ANALYZE YOUR_QUERY)
- Consider query complexity vs. result value trade-offs

## ❌ DON'Ts: Query Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. **DON'T** Use `SELECT *` on Large Tables

Avoid selecting all columns, especially on transaction and log tables.

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Select all columns unnecessarily
SELECT * 
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_time >= TIMESTAMP '2024-10-01'

-- ✅ GOOD: Select only needed columns
SELECT hash, from_address, to_address, value
FROM ethereum.transactions  
WHERE block_time >= TIMESTAMP '2024-10-01'
```

### 2. **DON'T** Create Unnecessary Subqueries

Avoid nested subqueries when JOINs or window functions work better.

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Inefficient correlated subquery
SELECT 
    b1.number,
    b1.gas_used,
    (
        SELECT AVG(b2.gas_used)
        FROM ethereum.blocks b2
        WHERE b2.time >= TIMESTAMP '2024-10-01'
          AND b2.number <= b1.number
          AND b2.number > b1.number - 100
    ) AS avg_100_blocks
FROM ethereum.blocks b1
WHERE b1.time >= TIMESTAMP '2024-10-01';

-- ✅ GOOD: Use window functions instead
WITH gas_used AS (
    SELECT 
        number,
        gas_used,
        AVG(gas_used) OVER (
            ORDER BY time
            ROWS BETWEEN 99 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW
        ) as avg_100_blocks
    FROM ethereum.blocks
    WHERE time >= TIMESTAMP '2024-10-01'
) 
SELECT 
    number,
    gas_used,
    avg_100_blocks
FROM gas_used
```

### 3. **DON'T** Use ORDER BY Without LIMIT on Large Results

Sorting large result sets is expensive.

```sql
-- ❌ BAD: Ordering large result set without limit
SELECT hash, gas_price
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_time >= TIMESTAMP '2024-10-01'
ORDER BY gas_price DESC

-- ✅ GOOD: Add LIMIT when ordering
SELECT hash, gas_price
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_time >= TIMESTAMP '2024-10-01'
ORDER BY gas_price DESC
LIMIT 10000
```


## Summary

Efficient DuneSQL queries on Dune require understanding the platform's time-partitioned architecture. Focus on:

1. **Time filtering** with time fields for partition pruning
2. **Column selection** to leverage columnar storage  
3. **Strategic joins** with proper filter placement
4. **Avoiding anti-patterns** that prevent optimizations
