This chapter describes the built-in SQL functions and operators supported by Trino. They allow you to implement complex functionality and behavior of the SQL executed by Trino operating on the underlying data sources.

Using ``SHOW FUNCTIONS`` in the query editor returns a list of all available functions, including custom functions, with all supported arguments and a short description.
