description: Explanation of the SS58 address encoding scheme used in Substrate chains.
---

ss58 or substrate58 is an address encoding scheme that is commonly used in substrate-based chains. It is similar to [Base58](/query-engine/Functions-and-operators/base58) encoding format, with some modifications.

Under basic ss58 encoding format an address can be encoded as:
```
base58encode ( concat ( <address-type>, <address>, <checksum> ) )
```

## Functions

#### from_ss58()
**`from_ss58(varchar)`** → `varbinary`

Converts an ss58-encoded string to the corresponding `VARBINARY` address.

```sql
SELECT 
    from_ss58('1qnJN7FViy3HZaxZK9tGAA71zxHSBeUweirKqCaox4t8GT7')
-- results in VARBINARY 0x2534454d30f8a028e42654d6b535e0651d1d026ddf115cef59ae1dd71bae074e
```

#### to_ss58()
**`to_ss58(varbinary, int)`** → `varchar`

Encodes an address of a specific network type into its ss58 `VARCHAR` representation. For example:
    * `Polkadot` has address type 0
    * `Kusama` has address type 2
    * `Generic Substrate` has address type 42

```sql
SELECT 
    to_ss58('0x2534454d30f8a028e42654d6b535e0651d1d026ddf115cef59ae1dd71bae074e', 2)
-- results 'DR6pMC4GJiVbgPtNNuw1xgxJyEsYYuXKXq7ZCVBjfFrh3V5'
```
