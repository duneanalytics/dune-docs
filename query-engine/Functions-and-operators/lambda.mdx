title: Lambda expressions
description: Lambda expressions are anonymous functions which are passed as arguments to higher-order SQL functions.
---

Lambda expressions are written with `->`:
```text
    x -> x + 1
    (x, y) -> x + y
    x -> regexp_like(x, 'a+')
    x -> x[1] / x[2]
    x -> IF(x > 0, x, -x)
    x -> COALESCE(x, 0)
    x -> CAST(x AS JSON)
    x -> x + TRY(1 / 0)
```
## Limitations

Most SQL expressions can be used in a lambda body, with a few
exceptions:

-   Subqueries are not supported: `x -> 2 + (SELECT 3)`
-   Aggregations are not supported: `x -> max(y)`

## Examples

Obtain the squared elements of an array column with
`transform`:
```sql
    SELECT numbers,
           transform(numbers, n -> n * n) as squared_numbers
    FROM (
        VALUES
            (ARRAY[1, 2]),
            (ARRAY[3, 4]),
            (ARRAY[5, 6, 7])
    ) AS t(numbers);
```
**Results**:  

| numbers   | squared_numbers |
|-----------|-----------------|
| [1, 2]    | [1, 4]          |
| [3, 4]    | [9, 16]         |
| [5, 6, 7] | [25, 36, 49]    |


The function `transform` can also be
employed to safely cast the elements of an array to strings:
```sql
    SELECT transform(prices, n -> TRY_CAST(n AS VARCHAR) || '$') as price_tags
    FROM (
        VALUES
            (ARRAY[100, 200]),
            (ARRAY[30, 4])
    ) AS t(prices);
```
**Results**: 

| price_tags  |
|-------------|
| [100$, 200$] |
| [30$, 4$]    |

Besides the array column being manipulated, other columns can be
captured as well within the lambda expression. The following statement
provides a showcase of this feature for calculating the value of the
linear function `f(x) = ax + b` with `transform`:
```sql
    SELECT xvalues,
           a,
           b,
           transform(xvalues, x -> a * x + b) as linear_function_values
    FROM (
        VALUES
            (ARRAY[1, 2], 10, 5),
            (ARRAY[3, 4], 4, 2)
    ) AS t(xvalues, a, b);
```
**Results**: 

| xvalues | a  | b | linear_function_values |
|---------|----|---|------------------------|
| [1, 2]  | 10 | 5 | [15, 25]               |
| [3, 4]  |  4 | 2 | [14, 18]               |


Find the array elements containing at least one value greater than `100`
with `any_match`:
```sql
    SELECT numbers
    FROM (
        VALUES
            (ARRAY[1,NULL,3]),
            (ARRAY[10,20,30]),
            (ARRAY[100,200,300])
    ) AS t(numbers)
    WHERE any_match(numbers, n ->  COALESCE(n, 0) > 100);
    -- [100, 200, 300]
```
Capitalize the first word in a string via `regexp_replace`:
```sql
    SELECT regexp_replace('once upon a time ...', '^(\w)(\w*)(\s+.*)$',x -> upper(x[1]) || x[2] || x[3]);
    -- Once upon a time ...
```

Lambda expressions can also be applied in aggregation functions.
The following statement is a sample of the overly complex calculation of the
sum of all elements of a column by making use of `reduce_agg`:
```sql
    SELECT reduce_agg(value, 0, (a, b) -> a + b, (a, b) -> a + b) sum_values
    FROM (
        VALUES (1), (2), (3), (4), (5)
    ) AS t(value);
    -- 15
```
