Tron blockchain adopted a custom type of addresses. It is similar to [Base58](/query-engine/Functions-and-operators/base58) encoding format, with some modifications.

Under basic tron address encoding format an address can be encoded as:
```
base58encode ( concat ( <constant-prefix>, <address>, <checksum> ) )
```

## Functions

#### from_tron_address()
**`from_tron_address(varchar)`** → `varbinary`

```sql
SELECT 
    from_tron_address('THHRK1bA7YRPZBcLnTP1SZy9ipUpsRwpo6')
-- results in VARBINARY 0x503aa4ad108bd3a89ba0310e23b49fb654cd6986
```

#### to_tron_address()
**`to_tron_address(varbinary)`** → `varchar`

```sql
SELECT 
    to_tron_address(0x503aa4ad108bd3a89ba0310e23b49fb654cd6986)
-- results 'THHRK1bA7YRPZBcLnTP1SZy9ipUpsRwpo6'
