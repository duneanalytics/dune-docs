## SQL Statement Syntax

Adhering to standard SQL syntax with clauses like SELECT, FROM, WHERE, DuneSQL enables complex queries for data retrieval and analysis while restricting data modification operations to preserve database integrity.

## Reserved Keywords

DuneSQL designates specific reserved keywords for internal functions, ensuring these are not used as identifiers, thus maintaining the engine's operational integrity.
