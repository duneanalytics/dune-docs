# Migrating from Flipside to Dune

With the recent shutdown of Flipside Creator Studio, we extend a warm welcome to all Flipside users exploring Dune. We understand that migrating your queries and workflows can be a challenging task. This guide is designed to help you transition smoothly by mapping Flipside's data tables to Dune's and highlighting the key differences between their respective SQL query engines.

Dune offers a powerful platform for blockchain analytics, powered by a community of thousands of creators. We're excited to have you join us\!

## Key Differences at a Glance

For a quick overview, here are some of the main differences between the Flipside and Dune platforms:

## Table Mappings: Flipside to Dune

Below is a comprehensive mapping of Flipside's tables to their Dune equivalents. We've done our best to find the closest match. In Dune, data is often more modular, so a single Flipside table might map to multiple Dune tables or require a `JOIN` operation to achieve the same result. Use the search bar in Dune's data explorer to find these tables.

| Flipside Table                  | Dune Table(s)                                                                                                                                                               | Migration Notes                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

| `FACT_BLOB_SIDECARS`            | `beacon.blobs`                                                                                                                                                              | Contains data on blob sidecars from the beacon chain RPC. This is a direct one-to-one mapping.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| `FACT_BLOCKS`                   | `beacon.blocks`                                                                                                                                                             | Contains consensus layer block data. This is a direct one-to-one mapping for raw block information.                                                                                                                                                              |
| `FACT_DEPOSITS`                 | `beacon.deposits`                                                                                                                                                           | Contains beacon chain deposit data. This is a direct mapping.                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `FACT_VALIDATORS`               | `beacon.validators`                                                                                                                                                         | Holds information about consensus layer validators. This is a direct one-to-one mapping.                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `FACT_VALIDATOR_BALANCES`       | `beacon.validator_day_summaries`                                                                                                                                            | Provides validator balance information. **Note the difference in granularity:** Flipside's table offered raw balance data, whereas Dune's `validator_day_summaries` provides balances aggregated by day, which is more efficient for daily trend analysis.       |
| `FACT_WITHDRAWALS`              | `beacon.withdrawals`                                                                                                                                                        | Details withdrawals from the beacon chain. This is a direct one-to-one mapping.                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `DIM_ORACLE_FEEDS`              | `chainlink_ethereum.oracle_addresses`                                                                                                                                       | Provides metadata for Chainlink oracles. **Note:** Replace `ethereum` with your target chain (e.g., `chainlink_optimism.oracle_addresses` for Optimism).                                                                                                         |
| `EZ_ORACLE_FEEDS`               | `chainlink.price_feeds`                                                                                                                                                     | Contains Chainlink price feed data. Dune's `chainlink.price_feeds` is a curated Spell that provides similar data, often with a more standardized schema across different chains.                                                                                 |
| `FACT_ORACLE_FEEDS`             | `chainlink.price_feeds`                                                                                                                                                     | Contains Chainlink price feed data. This maps directly to Dune's curated `chainlink.price_feeds` Spell.                                                                                                                                                          |
| `DIM_CONTRACTS`                 | `ethereum.contracts`                                                                                                                                                        | Contains metadata for deployed contracts. **Note:** Replace `ethereum` with your target chain. Dune also has a cross-chain `evms.contracts` table for multi-chain analysis.                                                                                      |
| `DIM_CONTRACT_ABIS`             | `ethereum.contracts`                                                                                                                                                        | Holds contract ABI data. Flipside had a separate table, but Dune integrates ABI information directly into the contracts table.                                                                                                                                   |
| `DIM_EVENT_SIGNATURES`          | `abi.signatures`; `decoding.evm_signatures`                                                                                                                                 | Contains event signatures for decoding. Dune provides `abi.signatures` for general signatures and `decoding.evm_signatures` for those actively used in decoding EVM data.                                                                                        |
| `DIM_FUNCTION_SIGNATURES`       | `abi.signatures`; `decoding.evm_signatures`                                                                                                                                 | Contains function signatures for decoding. Similar to event signatures, Dune separates these into general and EVM-specific tables.                                                                                                                               |
| `DIM_LABELS`                    | `labels.addresses`; `labels.owner_addresses`; `labels.owner_details`                                                                                                        | Contains address labels. **Note the structural difference:** Flipside used a single table, whereas Dune employs a more granular, multi-table structure that separates labels for addresses from labels for entities/owners. You may need to `JOIN` these tables. |
| `EZ_BALANCE_DELTAS`             | `balances_ethereum.erc20_day`; `ethereum.traces`                                                                                                                            | Provides token and native asset balance changes. On Dune, you can calculate balance deltas from daily balance tables or derive them from transfer tables like `erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer` and `ethereum.traces` (`value > 0`).                                 |
| `EZ_CURRENT_BALANCES`           | `balances_ethereum.erc20_latest`                                                                                                                                            | Provides current wallet balances. Dune's `balances_ethereum.erc20_latest` table provides the most recent balance for tokens, similar to Flipside's convenience table.                                                                                            |
| `EZ_NATIVE_TRANSFERS`           | `tokens.transfers`                                                                                                                                                           | This is a direct mapping to the `tokens.transfers` table.      |
| `EZ_SNAPSHOT`                   | `dune.shot.dataset_follows`<br />`dune.shot.dataset_proposals_view`<br />`dune.shot.dataset_spaces_view`<br />`dune.shot.dataset_users`<br />`dune.shot.dataset_votes_view` | Contains off-chain Snapshot voting data. **Note the structural difference:** Flipside aggregated this into a single table. Dune ingests Snapshot's data into multiple, more granular tables that you will need to `JOIN` using proposal or space IDs.            |
| `EZ_TOKEN_TRANSFERS`            | `erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer`                                                                                                                                               | Contains ERC-20 token transfer events. Dune's decoded event tables provide the raw transfer data. For aggregated, cleaned data across all chains, use the curated `tokens.transfers` table.                                                                      |
| `FACT_BLOCKS`                   | `ethereum.blocks`                                                                                                                                                           | Provides execution-layer block data. For raw block data, `ethereum.blocks` is a direct match. For aggregated metrics like daily gas fees, Dune offers pre-computed tables in the `dune` schema.                                                                  |
| `FACT_CONTRACT_READS`           | Decoded call tables (e.g., `aave_v3_ethereum.AToken_call_balanceOf`)                                                                                                        | Contains data from contract reads. On Dune, this corresponds to decoded call tables for specific protocols. Use the data explorer to find the specific contract and function you need.                                                                           |
| `FACT_DECODED_EVENT_LOGS`       | Decoded event tables (e.g., `erc20_ethereum.evt_Transfer`)                                                                                                                  | Contains decoded event logs. This is a core feature of Dune. Instead of one large table, Dune has individual decoded event tables for popular contracts, which are much more efficient to query.                                                                 |
| `FACT_DECODED_TRACES`           | Decoded call tables (e.g., `uniswap_v3_ethereum.Factory_call_createPool`)                                                                                                   | Contains decoded trace/call data. Similar to events, Dune provides decoded call tables for specific function calls on popular contracts.                                                                                                                         |

## Migrating Queries: From Snowflake to Dune SQL (Trino)

The most significant adjustment you'll make when migrating from Flipside is the query engine. Flipside utilized Snowflake's SQL dialect, whereas Dune is powered by **Dune SQL**, which is based on **Trino** (formerly PrestoSQL). While both are standards-compliant, Trino has its own flavor and functions that differ from Snowflake.

Let's walk through the most common changes you'll need to make to your queries.

### 1. The `0x` Prefix and Byte Arrays: A Critical Difference

In Dune, blockchain addresses, transaction hashes, and other raw byte data are stored as `VARBINARY` types, not simple strings. When you filter by or insert these values in your queries, you **must** prefix them with `0x`. This is one of the most common tripping points for new users.

**Dune SQL (Correct):**

```sql
-- Filtering for transactions to a specific address
SELECT *
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE "to" = 0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e -- Uniswap V2: Router 2
```

**Flipside/Snowflake (and incorrect in Dune):**

```sql
-- This will fail or return no results in Dune
SELECT *
FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE "to" = '0x742d35Cc6634C0532925a3b844Bc454e4438f44e'
```

<Note>
  **Pro tip:** When copying addresses from block explorers, they typically include the `0x` prefix. In Dune, simply remove the quotes around the address to use it as a `VARBINARY` literal.
</Note>

### 2. Common Syntax Adjustments

Here are some of the most frequent syntax adjustments you'll encounter.

#### Identifier Quoting

This should be an easy transition. Both Snowflake and Trino follow the ANSI SQL standard and use double quotes (`"`) to quote identifiers (e.g., column names with spaces or reserved words like `"from"` or `"to"`). Your quoting syntax will likely not need to change.

- **Snowflake/Dune SQL (Trino):** `SELECT "from", "to" FROM "my_table";`

#### Data Type Casting

Snowflake commonly uses `::` for casting. Dune SQL uses the ANSI SQL standard `CAST(column AS TYPE)`.

- **Snowflake:** `SELECT '123'::integer, '2023-01-01'::date;`
- **Dune SQL:** `SELECT CAST('123' AS integer), CAST('2023-01-01' AS date);`

#### Accessing JSON Data

Accessing nested data in JSON objects requires specific functions in Trino. While Snowflake uses a colon (`:`), Trino uses `json_extract_scalar`.

- **Snowflake:** `SELECT my_json_column:key::string FROM my_table;`
- **Dune SQL (Trino):** `SELECT json_extract_scalar(my_json_column, '$.key') FROM my_table;`

### 3. Key Function and Pattern Changes

#### Flattening Arrays with `UNNEST`

To un-nest array elements into their own rows, Snowflake uses `LATERAL FLATTEN()`. The Trino equivalent is `UNNEST`.

**Snowflake:**

```sql
SELECT t.id, value:name::string
FROM my_table t,
LATERAL FLATTEN(input => t.my_json_array);
```

**Dune SQL (Trino):**

```sql
SELECT t.id, item.name
FROM my_table t
CROSS JOIN UNNEST(t.my_json_array) AS t(item)
```

#### Filtering Window Functions (Replacing `QUALIFY`)

Snowflake's `QUALIFY` clause is a convenient way to filter the results of a window function. `QUALIFY` is not available in Dune SQL. The standard approach is to use a subquery or a Common Table Expression (CTE), which works perfectly in Trino.

**Snowflake:**

```sql
SELECT *
FROM my_table
QUALIFY ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY timestamp DESC) = 1;
```

**Dune SQL (Trino):**

```sql
WITH ranked_rows AS (
    SELECT *,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY id ORDER BY timestamp DESC) as rn
    FROM my_table
)
SELECT * FROM ranked_rows
WHERE rn = 1;
```

### 4. Common Migration Examples

Here are some practical examples of migrating common Flipside query patterns to Dune:

#### Example 1: Daily DEX Volume Analysis

**Flipside Pattern:**

```sql
SELECT 
    block_timestamp::date as date,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM ethereum.core.ez_dex_swaps
WHERE block_timestamp >= '2024-01-01'::date
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

**Dune Equivalent:**

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) as date,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM dex.trades
WHERE block_time >= CAST('2024-01-01' AS date)
    AND blockchain = 'ethereum'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1;
```

#### Example 2: Token Balance Analysis

**Flipside Pattern:**

```sql
SELECT 
    user_address,
    symbol,
    current_bal
FROM ethereum.core.ez_current_balances
WHERE contract_address = '0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48'::string;
```

**Dune Equivalent:**

```sql
SELECT 
    address as user_address,
    symbol,
    amount_raw / POW(10, decimals) as current_bal
FROM balances_ethereum.erc20_latest
WHERE contract_address = 0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48; -- USDC
```

### 5. Query Performance Tips

Many Flipside tables encouraged filtering by `block_timestamp::date` for performance. In Dune, many raw and curated tables are physically partitioned by date-based columns (like `block_day` or `block_time`). Always add a filter on these partitioned columns where available, as it can dramatically speed up your queries by reducing the amount of data scanned.

You can find partition keys in the schema browser in the query editor.

**Performance Best Practices:**

- Always filter by `block_time` or `block_date` when available
- Use the curated Spells (like `dex.trades`, `nft.trades`) instead of raw tables when possible
- Limit your date ranges to what you actually need for analysis
- Use `LIMIT` clauses during development to avoid scanning large datasets

## Understanding Dune's Data Platform

Dune's approach to data is layered, providing different levels of abstraction to make analysis easier:

1. **Raw Data:** Raw, unprocessed data from the blockchain (e.g., `ethereum.blocks`, `ethereum.transactions`). This is your source of truth.
2. **Decoded Data:** Raw data is decoded into human-readable tables. For example, contract events are decoded into tables like `aave_v3_ethereum.Supply`. This saves you the effort of dealing with logs and topics.
3. **Curated Data (Spells):** These are higher-level abstractions built and maintained by the community. Tables like `dex.trades` or `nft.trades` aggregate data across multiple protocols, making cross-platform analysis simple.

We encourage you to explore the [data catalog](/data-catalog) in the Dune app to discover the wealth of datasets available.

## Common Migration Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Missing Convenience Tables

**Issue:** Flipside provided many "EZ\_" convenience tables that aggregated complex data.
**Solution:** Dune's curated Spells (like `dex.trades`, `nft.trades`) often provide even better aggregations. If a specific convenience table doesn't exist, you can often recreate it using raw or decoded data.

### Challenge 2: Different Table Schemas

**Issue:** Column names and data types may differ between platforms.
**Solution:** Use Dune's data explorer to examine table schemas. The `DESCRIBE` command can also help: `DESCRIBE dex.trades;`

### Challenge 3: Cross-Chain Analysis

**Issue:** Flipside often had separate databases per chain.
**Solution:** Dune's curated tables often include a `blockchain` column, making cross-chain analysis much easier. Simply add `WHERE blockchain IN ('ethereum', 'polygon')` to your queries.
