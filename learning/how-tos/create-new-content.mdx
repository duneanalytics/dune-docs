Dive into the world of Dune and explore the myriad of content creation possibilities it offers. This guide will walk you through the various types of content you can craft on Dune and the steps to bring them to life.

## Crafting Queries, Dashboards, and Datasets
1. Navigate to the “+Create” button located at the top of the page.
2. From the dropdown, you have the option to:
    - Initiate new queries.
    - Design new dashboards.
    - Upload on-chain or off-chain datasets as per your requirements.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(55.052083333333336% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/Yb1BO8bjDTYYSmqXkeU7?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Plus button content creation"
  />
</div>

Once uploaded, your datasets can be found under the “Your Data” section within the data explorer.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(55.052083333333336% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}

  <iframe

    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Access your uploaded data"
  />
</div>

## Submitting Contracts for Decoding
If you're keen on analyzing a contract or project that hasn't been decoded yet on Dune, here's what you can do:

1. Submit the contract for decoding.
2. Once submitted, the automated decoding process kicks in.
3. After a brief wait, your decoded contract will appear under the “Decoded Projects” category.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(55.052083333333336% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}

  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/5QKu7QRwdznPpUvUeF7N?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Submit contract for decoding"
  />
</div>

## Create Visualization Widgets
You can create visualization widgets from any existing query results by clicking the "New visualization" button and choosing the type of charts you want. Of course you can customize the charts to your liking. 

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(55.052083333333336% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}

  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/s4lqTkO8NPdmNDsbADSO?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="create new viz"
  />
</div>

## Forking Queries
If you stumble upon a query that almost meets your needs but requires a few tweaks:

1. Click on the “Fork” button located in the upper right corner.
2. Modify the forked query as per your requirements.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(55.052083333333336% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}

  <iframe

    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="How to fork"

</div>
