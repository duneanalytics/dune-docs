description: How to efficiently search for content on Dune
---

With over 100K dashboards, 700K saved queries, and a continuous influx of new content each week, navigating Dune can sometimes feel overwhelming. However, with a grasp of the basics, finding what you need becomes a breeze.

In this guide, we'll walk you through the essentials of searching for content on Dune, focusing on three primary areas:

- Discover page
- Global search bar
- Library

## Discover Page 
Navigate to the Discover page to begin your exploration. Here, you'll find four categories to delve into: dashboards, queries, wizards (our esteemed creators ðŸ§™ on Dune), and teams.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(52.10884353741496% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/f8c4dMw9EoEV9OKX19ka?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Discover - categories"
  />
</div>

For both dashboards and queries, you can refine your search based on:

- Favorites: Sort by the number of stars received within a specific timeframe.
- Trending: Identify popular content within a selected period.
- New: Filter by the content's creation date.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(52.10884353741496% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}

  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/WOB1n0qemXfRnBbyUcCr?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Rank Dashboards by "
  />
</div>

By default, the Discover page showcases trending dashboards from the past 4 hours. This feature offers a real-time glimpse into the crypto world, highlighting what others are currently viewing and creating. It's an invaluable resource for spotting early trends and insights.

## Global Search Bar
- Click on the search bar located at the top left or use the shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + P.
- Enter your desired keywords.
- The results will display related dashboards, queries, wizards, or teams.
- Dive deeper into a category (e.g., "Dashboards") and select your preferred ranking criteria.
- Choose the content that best suits your needs.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(52.10884353741496% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}

  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/vmT4SVxeLuepfn5WSYuF?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Global search bar plus dashboard rank"
  />
</div>

<Tip>When searching for a dashboard, consider the number of stars it has received and its creator. For added assurance, you can also review the query's source code to understand its logic.</Tip>

## Library: A Hub for Your Creations 
To access content you've personally created, visit your library. Here, you can find all your dashboards and queries. Enhance your organization by categorizing them into various "Folders". Additionally, the library allows you to search, filter, and sort your content based on different criteria.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(55.052083333333336% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/SXmxfjlQmJsq6fnfn3rk?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Library for your own creation"
  />
</div>

It's crucial to note that the Library's content is context-sensitive. Depending on the user or team profile you're viewing, you'll see creations specific to that account.

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(55.052083333333336% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}

    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
    title="Library context switching"
  />
</div>
