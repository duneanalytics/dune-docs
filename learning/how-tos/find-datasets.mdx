Navigating over a million data tables on Dune might seem daunting. This guide simplifies the process, highlighting the categories of datasets available and offering tips on efficient searching.

## Categories of Datasets

Dune processes blockchain data in several stages: ingestion, decoding, aggregation, and standardization. This results in three main categories: raw, decoded, and curated. Additionally, there's a community category that houses community-supported off-chain datasets like Reservoir, Snapshot, and others.

Beyond these, Dune showcases the most frequently used datasets under the “essential” category. Your materialized query results are neatly categorized under “materialized views”.

**Heuristics for when to use which categories**
    - Starting Point: If unsure, begin with the “Essentials” category.
    - Protocol-Specific Analysis: The “Decoded projects” category is ideal. Filter by a specific chain, event, or function to expedite your search.
    - Ecosystem Research: The “Raw” category is a good starting point. Alternatively, the “Spells” category might have pre-aggregated data for your analysis
