title: Create and Manage Teams on Dune
description: A step-by-step guide to creating and managing team accounts on Dune.
---

## Dune for Teams
- **Create a team account on Dune** to enhance collaboration with a shared workspace. 
- **Team accounts** can be established without a paid plan, but [Plus/Premium subscription features](https://dune.com/pricing) are available only to teams, not individual accounts.

**This guide provides detailed steps to help you set up and manage your team effectively.**

## Setting Up a Team
1. **Navigate to the global context switcher** at the top of your dashboard.
2. **Select “Create new team”** from the dropdown menu.
3. **Complete the team creation process** by following the on-screen instructions.

<Note>Every account on Dune, be it individual or team-based, requires a unique identifier or slug. Each team must have a unique name that has not been used before.</Note>

</div>

## Inviting Members & Assigning Roles
After setting up your team:
- **Invite New Members:** Click on **“Invite People”** and follow the instructions. During this process, assign [roles](/web-app/teams) to each new member:
  - **Admins** have full control over settings and memberships.
  - **Editors** can create and edit content.
  - **Viewers** can only view content.
- **Use a URL to Invite Members:** Alternatively, share a direct invitation URL with prospective team members.

## Managing Subscriptions
Manage your team's subscriptions and settings by navigating to the **team account settings page**, where you can:
- **Modify Your Plan:** Change your subscription plan or opt for annual billing to save costs.
- **View Usage Statistics:** Check your usage of credits, CSV uploads, and private content quotas.
- **Manage Additional Credits:** If you need more credits than your plan provides, adjust the **“Limit extra credits”** field to set a maximum dollar amount for additional purchases. *The default limit is $0 to prevent unexpected charges.*

  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(55.052083333333336% + 41px)",
    height: 0,
    width: "100%"
  }}

</div>

This section allows you to manage the **“pay-as-you-go”** feature. If you wish to purchase additional credits beyond your plan's allocation, adjust the **“Limit extra credits”** field. Set a maximum dollar amount for additional credits. By default, this limit is set to $0.
