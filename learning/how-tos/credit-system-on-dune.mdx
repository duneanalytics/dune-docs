Dune's operations largely rely on a credit system. This guide will explain the concept of credits, their consumption, and management.

### What are credits?
Credits are the key to accessing a wide range of functions on the Dune platform. Whether you're delving into writing queries or simply exploring dashboards, knowing how credits operate is crucial.

### Why are credits important?
All actions on Dune, from refreshing a dashboard to exporting data via the API, consume credits. It's vital for every user, viewer, or creator alike, to be mindful of their credit usage.

## Your Credit Allocation

No worries, every Dune user gets a monthly credit allowance. Here's how it works:

### üéüÔ∏è Monthly Credit Allowance
- **Set Number of Credits:** Each month, your subscription plan provides a set allotment of credits.
- **Top-Up:** Run out of credits? Our "pay as you go" option lets you add more anytime, ensuring your work always flows.

### üîÑ Rollover Policy
- **Monthly Refresh:** Credits reset at the start of each billing cycle; they do not roll over to the next month.
- **Maximize Use:** Plan your activities to maximize the utility of your credits.

### üë• Team Accounts
- **Collective Pool:** All team members draw from a shared pot of credits. Sync up to make the most of your resources.
