title: Build a Frame with Dune API
description: How to build a Farcaster Frame using Frog and Dune API
---

This guide provides a step-by-step process on using typescript and Dune API to create a user recommendation frame for Farcaster. You can find a [live example of the frame here](https://warpcast.com/~/conversations/0x62b84d8405fe6e9ff1639055852d98f910b4c595).

## Set up your environment with the example repo

[Fork this repo](https://github.com/andrewhong5297/dune-frames) and then run `npm install -g frog` and `npm install` to get all your packages. If you don't have npm set up, then [go download node js first](https://nodejs.org/en/download). Once installations are finished, try running `npm run dev` and it should take you to a localhost environment at http://localhost:5173/api.

Next, you'll need to get a Dune API key from [your user settings](https://dune.com/settings/api) and export it. With that done, you'll be able to run the frame - click "See From Your Followers" in your localhost environment.

## Explaining the Dune API function

We call the Dune API in the `/api/dune.ts` file in the `getRecommendations(fid)` function [defined here](https://github.com/andrewhong5297/dune-frames/blob/main/api/dune.ts#L10).

Below is the main API call, which makes a [FILTER](/api-reference/executions/filtering) call on an [existing result set](/api-reference/executions/endpoint/get-query-result). Using filters, we get our results in 20-30ms instead of reruning the whole query (which may take 10-20 seconds).

```javascript
//schedule the query on a 6-hour interval, and then fetch by filtering for the user fid within the query results
//dune query where each row is a unique fid and each column is a recommended set of users: https://dune.com/queries/3509966
const meta = {
    "x-dune-api-key": DUNE_API_KEY || ""
};
const header = new Headers(meta);
const latest_response = await fetch(`https://api.dune.com/api/v1/query/3509966/results?&filters=query_fid=${fid}` //filter for single fid
, {
    method: 'GET',
    headers: header,
});

const body = await latest_response.text();
const recs = JSON.parse(body).result.rows[0]; //will only be one row in the result, for the filtered fid
```

You can write your own aggregation queries in the same format, and then use filters to make the API fast enough for app/frame development. Good luck!
