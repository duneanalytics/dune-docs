After executing a query, you'll be presented with a set of results. The next logical step? Visualize that data for a clearer insight. This guide will show you how to layer a combined bar and line chart atop the data from [Create your first query](/learning/how-tos/create-your-first-query).

Here is a visual click-through version if you are more of a visual learner. Below is a written version. 

<div
  style={{
    position: "relative",
    paddingBottom: "calc(55.052083333333336% + 41px)",
    height: 0
  }}
>
  <iframe
    src="https://demo.arcade.software/w7bs2kM4P4Kg42PONF84?embed"
    frameBorder={0}
    loading="lazy"
    webkitallowfullscreen=""
    mozallowfullscreen=""
    allowFullScreen=""
    style={{
      position: "absolute",
      top: 0,
      left: 0,
      width: "100%",
      height: "100%",
      colorScheme: "light"
    }}
  />
</div>

1. **Begin Visualization**: Click on "New Visualization" and select your desired chart type. For this tutorial, initiate with a bar chart and click "Add Visualization."
2. **Display Data**: By default, the chart will showcase `monthly_gas_spent`. To augment the depth of insights, include the `cumulative_gas_spent` column.
3. **Adjust Chart Type**: Transition the representation of `cumulative_gas_spent` from a bar to a line chart, offering a more nuanced view.
4. **Fine-tune Your Chart**: Customize the display values for a polished look. For detailed formatting guidance, [refer to this resource](query-app/web-app/visualizations/charts-graphs).
