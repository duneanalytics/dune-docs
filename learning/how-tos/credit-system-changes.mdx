# How Credits Work on Dune is Changing

## How you spend credits on Dune is changing

We're improving how Dune credit usage works to ensure our platform is fair and enables exciting new capabilities and features for all users.

### What's changing and why?

Historically, our query engine charged a fixed number of credits per execution, a simple approach for analysts but ultimately **unfair and limiting**: simpler queries were overcharged, complex queries undercharged, and query timeouts restricted capabilities.

As Dune adoption grows—spanning over **100 chains, complex tables, and new ways to consume data through APIs and dbt-style connectors—both we and our customers need pricing that scales with real usage**.

This new engine brings that flexibility. **Your credit system remains the same, but now when you run a query, credits are spent in proportion to the consumed resources.** This means that small, simple queries will become cheaper and larger queries can run longer (better timeouts).

**Key benefits:**
- **Usage-based** – Pay in proportion to actual consumption.
- **Efficiency** – Incentives to write cleaner, optimized queries.
- **Scalability** – Sustainable future support for larger workloads with longer timeouts and advanced integrations like **dbt**, **Trino REST API**, **SQL Mesh**, AI-driven workflows, and expanded connector options to come in the near future.

This fair, usage-based model ensures Dune can keep pace with your most ambitious data needs.

### How does this affect how I use Dune?

Beginning October 21st, we will begin migrating users and teams over to the usage-based credit spending. The migration for your user or team will occur at the end of your first billing cycle after October 21st.

**Credit Pricing = Overage Pricing**  
Overage is now charged at the same rate as your plan. The price per 100 credits shown for each plan is what you pay for any usage beyond your included credits, keeping things simple and transparent.

**Analyst Plan Pricing Update**
- **Monthly plans**: New pricing of $75/month, up from $49/month, takes effect at your first billing cycle after October 21st.
- **Annual plans**: New pricing of $65/month ($780/year), up from $45/month, takes effect at your first annual renewal after October 21st.

:::tip
This adjustment ensures sustainable economics as Dune scales to support 100+ chains and complex workflows. Your 4,000 credits will go further with usage-based pricing, meaning lighter queries cost less, giving you more value.

:::warning
**Note:** All plans will transition to usage-based credit consumption by their next monthly billing cycle after October 21st (including all annual plans). However, Analyst annual plans will adopt their new pricing at their next annual renewal cycle.

**Quick Plan Reference**
- **Free**: Remains free with 2,500 credits ($5.00 per 100 credits).
- **Analyst Pricing Changes to**:
  - **Monthly:** $75/month for monthly subscriptions which includes 4,000 credits/month ($1.875 per 100 credits).
  - **Yearly:** $780/year for annual subscriptions which includes 4,000 credits/month ($1.625 per 100 credits).
- **Plus Pricing Remains**:
  - **Monthly:** $399/month for monthly subscriptions which includes 25,000 credits/month ($1.596 per 100 credits).
  - **Yearly:** $4,188/year for annual subscriptions which includes 25,000 credits/month ($1.396 per 100 credits).
- **Premium**: Existing Premium customers will continue to be supported on their current plans. However, the Premium plan will no longer be available to *new* sign-ups or to users who downgrade and later wish to return. If you need support or have questions, please [contact us](mailto:support@dune.com) via email.
- **Enterprise**: Whether you're an existing plan considering an upgrade or a new team, we can custom tailor a plan to your pricing needs at [dune.com/enterprise](http://dune.com/enterprise).

### What can I do to prepare?

- **Review your usage.** Check your query volume and costs to understand where you stand before the change takes place.
- **Optimize your queries.** Efficient queries save credits and run faster. See [here](https://docs.dune.com/query-engine/writing-efficient-queries) for tips.
- **Pick the plan that fits.** If you anticipate heavy usage or notice overages, please contact our sales team at [dune.com/enterprise](http://dune.com/enterprise) to discuss the best plan for your needs.
- **Cap your query costs.** Use our new feature to cap the amount of credits you're willing to spend on a query.

### Important Dates

- **October 7th-20th**: New pricing in effect for net-new subscriptions.
- **October 21st:** The new usage-based model will apply to your plan on **your first new monthly billing cycle after this date**.

## FAQ

### Pricing & Plans

**Q: Why is Dune changing its credit system and engines?**

A: The old system charged a fixed number of credits per query, regardless of complexity. This was simple but unfair; lightweight queries were overcharged while complex queries were undercharged. Our new usage-based model aligns cost with actual compute, providing everyone with a fairer and more flexible experience.

**Q: Will there still be a Free plan?**

A: Yes. The Free plan remains and still includes **2,500 credits per month at no cost**. With the new usage-based engine, credits are consumed based on actual query resources. Small, efficient queries may use fewer credits than before, allowing you to run more queries within your monthly allowance. Larger or more complex queries will use credits more quickly. If you consistently need more capacity, you can upgrade to a paid plan anytime.

**Q: Can I run bigger queries if I stay on a Free plan?**

A: Yes, but you will be limited to the Small and Medium engine. If you often hit timeout limits, consider the Analyst or Plus plans.

**Q: Do I need to rewrite my queries?**

A: No. All existing queries will run as before. However, more efficient queries will consume fewer credits, so optimizing your queries can help you save on cost.

**Q: How are credits now calculated?**

A: Credits are based on the actual compute effort measured in CPU-seconds and network resources a query consumes. This means lightweight queries cost fewer credits, while complex, resource-intensive operations require more credits.

**Q: Will my monthly cost increase?**

A: It depends on your usage pattern. Light or efficient workloads will likely cost less. Heavy workloads may cost more, but you'll gain the ability to run larger, more complex queries without timeout limitations. You can set both query credit cost caps and overage limits in Settings to ensure your spending stays within comfortable boundaries.

**Q: I run a lot of API queries. Will they cost more?**

A: Cost will depend on compute used by those API queries. After October 21st, you can check the new usage dashboard in Settings to track API-specific consumption.

**Q: What happens to the Premium plan?**

A: Existing Premium customers will continue to be supported on their current plans. However, the Premium plan will no longer be available to *new* sign-ups or to users who downgrade and later wish to return. If you regularly exceed 25,000 credits/month or need guaranteed performance for large workloads, contact [sales](http://dune.com/enterprise) about Enterprise pricing.

**Q: What happens if I have a scheduled downgrade for a plan that occurs after October 21st, 2025?**

A: If you are downgrading to an Analyst plan, the new pricing will take effect ($65/month for annual users and $75/month for monthly users). If you are on a Premium plan, after downgrading, you will lose access to the Premium plan going forward.

**Q: How does the new engine affect my enterprise contract?**

A: Your custom contract remains in place. Your account manager will work with you to align credit allocation, pricing, and engines when your contract renews.

---

### Migration & Timeline

**Q: When will the change take effect?**

A: Oct 21, 2025. All customers except Enterprise customers will be on the new credit system and engine.

**Q: Do I need to take any action to migrate?**

A: No action is required; your account/team will automatically move to the new credit system and engine.

---

### Usage & Monitoring

**Q: How can I monitor my credit consumption?**

A: A new usage and billing dashboard will show credits used, overages, and historical usage.

**Q: Will I see the cost before running a query?**

A: You'll see costs after execution. We are evaluating the option to add pre-run cost estimates in a future update.

**Q: Can I run bigger queries now?**

A: Yes. The new pricing structure supports more complex queries and higher data volumes without timeouts.

---

### Optimization & Support

**Q: How can I lower my credit usage?**

A: Write efficient SQL, limit unnecessary joins or scans, and reuse results when possible. Our docs include [query optimization tips](https://docs.dune.com/query-engine/writing-efficient-queries).

**Q: What if I consistently exceed my plan credits?**

A: You can upgrade to a higher plan or contact our sales team to discuss a custom Enterprise solution.

**Q: Who do I contact for help?**

A: Reach out to support@dune.com or your Dune account manager for Enterprise plans.
