Blockchains are open and transparent, but each chain is unique—making it difficult to understand, ingest, and aggregate data. Dune gives you the tools to analyze cross-chain data for different tokens, wallets, and protocols. You can also easily share your work with the community, export and integrate data into your own applications, and more.

### Why Dune?

Dune—along with our massive community of users and experts—provides powerful tools and analysis of all onchain data. You can find a [dashboard](https://dune.com/browse/dashboards?q=dex\&order=favorites\&time_range=all) for pretty much anything web3-related, including for EVMs like Ethereum, Polygon, Goerli, and Optimism—and non-EVM chains like Solana and Bitcoin.
