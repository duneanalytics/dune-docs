# How Our Data Works

A transparent look at how Dune ingests, processes, and serves blockchain data.

## Data Pipeline Overview

[TODO: Architecture diagram showing complete data flow]

## Ingestion

[TODO: Content - How we connect to nodes, RPC providers, archive nodes]

## Processing Stages

### Raw Data Extraction
[TODO: Content - Blocks, transactions, logs, traces extraction]

### Decoding
[TODO: Content - ABI decoding process, contract submission, auto-detection]

### Curated Table Generation
[TODO: Content - Spellbook process, dbt models, quality checks]

## Storage Architecture

[TODO: Content - Column-store, partitioning strategy, query optimization]

## Update Frequency

[TODO: Content - How often data is updated, chain-specific details]

## Data Lineage

[TODO: Content - Tracing data from source to curated tables]
