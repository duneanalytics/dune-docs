Aggregated DEX swap data across all supported chains and protocols.

## Quick Example

```sql
SELECT * FROM dex.trades 
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '7' day
LIMIT 100
```

## Methodology

### Data Sources
[TODO: Document which protocols/contracts feed this table]

### Transformation Logic
[TODO: Document how raw data becomes this curated table]

### What's Included
[TODO: List of chains, protocols, time range]

### What's NOT Included
[TODO: Known gaps, exclusions, edge cases]

### Known Limitations
[TODO: Freshness, performance considerations]

FROM dex.trades
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC, 3 DESC
```

SELECT 
    token_pair,
    COUNT(*) as trade_count,
    SUM(amount_usd) as total_volume
FROM dex.trades
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '7' day
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 20
