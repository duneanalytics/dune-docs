# Curated Tables

Production-ready analytical tables built and maintained by Dune, with full methodology documentation.

## What Are Curated Tables?

Curated tables are pre-built datasets that aggregate and normalize data across chains and protocols. Each table includes:

- **Full methodology documentation** — Understand exactly how the data is generated
- **Cross-chain coverage** — Unified schema across all supported chains
- **Quality guarantees** — Validated and monitored for accuracy
- **Regular updates** — Maintained by the Dune data team
