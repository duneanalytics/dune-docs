## What is Sui?

Sui is a layer 1 blockchain protocol designed for high performance and scalability. The name derives from the Japanese word for water, reflecting the platform's fluid and adaptable nature. Sui features several key innovations:

- **Object-Centric Architecture**: Unlike traditional blockchains that use key-value stores, Sui treats blocks as objects that define assets, enabling more sophisticated programmability.
- **Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS)**: Energy-efficient consensus mechanism where validators stake SUI tokens to secure the network.
- **Move Programming Language**: A robust logic engine specifically designed for Sui's object-based approach to blockchain technology.
- **Parallel Transaction Processing**: Enables high throughput by processing independent transactions simultaneously.

## Sui Networks

Sui operates across multiple networks serving different purposes:

- **Mainnet**: Production network processing real transactions and handling SUI trading and NFT activities
- **Testnet**: Staging environment for quality assurance and developer testing
- **Devnet**: Development network for testing new features and latest planned capabilities
- **Localnet**: Local development environment for optimized workflows

## SUI Token Economics

The native token for Sui is **SUI**, with **MIST** serving as the smallest unit (1 SUI = 1 billion MIST). All transaction costs, including gas fees and data storage, are paid using SUI tokens. The platform uses a delegated proof-of-stake model where validators must stake SUI to participate in consensus, aligning their interests with network security and efficiency.
