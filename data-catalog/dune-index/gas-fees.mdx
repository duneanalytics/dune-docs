## Overview

Transaction fees represent the dollar costs of executing operations on blockchain networks. By measuring transaction fees, we can understand the demand for resources on the network and the incentives that drive user behavior.
Gas fee calculations are more complex than they may seem at first glance. This is because different networks have different fee structures, and some even have multiple components to their fees. We are aggregating the data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of the fees paid for each network.

You can explore the daily gas fee data via `metrics.gas_fees_daily`

### EVM Networks

For EVM networks, we have developed a unified model to calculate transaction fees consistently across different types of chains. The data is accessible through the `gas.fees` table, which standardizes the fee components into `l1_fee`, `base_fee`, and `priority_fee`. This model elegantly unifies the fee structures of rollups, L1s, and L2s, providing a coherent view of gas costs across the EVM ecosystem. However, it's important to note that the specific fee components and their calculations may vary depending on the unique characteristics and design choices of each network. You can find the fee components for each network below.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Arbitrum">
    Arbitrum uses a custom L1/L2 fee model that ignores priority fees (tips) in calculations and uses effective_gas_price instead of standard gas_price. This helps account for the actual costs of posting data to the L1 chain.

    ```sql
    -- Two component fee structure
    l1_fee = gas_used_for_l1 * effective_gas_price
    base_fee = (gas_used - gas_used_for_l1) * effective_gas_price
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Avalanche C-Chain">
    Avalanche C-Chain uses a standard fee structure with a base fee and an optional priority fee. This allows users to tip validators for faster transaction inclusion.

    ```sql
    -- Two component fee structure (if priority fee exists)
    base_fee = base_fee_per_gas * gas_used
    priority_fee = priority_fee_per_gas * gas_used
    -- Single component fee structure (if no priority fee)
    base_fee = gas_price * gas_used
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Base">
    Base employs a custom L1/L2 fee model with additional L1 data fields. This helps track the costs associated with posting data to the L1 chain for security.

    ```sql
    -- Three component fee structure
    l1_fee = l1_fee
    base_fee = base_fee_per_gas * gas_used
    priority_fee = priority_fee_per_gas * gas_used
    -- Two component fee structure (if no priority fee)
    l1_fee = l1_fee
    base_fee = gas_price * gas_used
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Blast">
    Blast uses a custom L1/L2 fee model with additional L1 data fields. This allows tracking the L1 data posting costs separately from the L2 execution fees.

    ```sql
    -- Three component fee structure
    l1_fee = l1_fee
    base_fee = base_fee_per_gas * gas_used
    priority_fee = priority_fee_per_gas * gas_used
    -- Two component fee structure (if no priority fee)
    l1_fee = l1_fee
    base_fee = gas_price * gas_used
    ```

  </Tab>

  <Tab title="BNB Chain">

{" "}
<Tab title="Tron">
  Tron uses a simplified fee structure using only gas price and gas used. This
  provides a straightforward way to calculate transaction fees. Tron also
  subsidizes the fees for transactions, so the fee paid is not necessarily the
  actual cost of the transaction. We are correcting for this in the
  `metrics.gas_fees_daily` table, but not in gas.fees yet.
  
  ```sql
  tx_fee_raw = gas_used * gas_price

### Non-EVM Networks

For non-EVM networks we haven't yet found a consistent way to model the fee structure, so we are not yet able to provide a unified model for non-EVM networks. However, all the data is included in the `metrics.gas_fees_daily` table.

#### Solana

Solana has two "types" of transactions: _transactions_ and _votes_. We track the fees for each type separately in `gas_solana.tx_fees` and `gas_solana.vote_fees`.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Solana Transactions">
    Solana uses a custom fee structure with a base fee and an optional prioritization fee for transactions. The base fee is calculated based on the number of signatures required for the transaction, while the prioritization fee depends on the compute unit price and compute budget limit.

    ```sql
    -- Two component fee structure
    base_fee = # of signatures * 0.000005
    priority_fee = compute_unit_price * compute_budget_limit
    ```

    This data is standardized in `gas_solana.tx_fees`.

  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Solana Votes">  
    In Solana, votes that help the network reach consensus are also considered transactions. The fees are always 0.000005 SOL per vote, which is the base fee for a transaction with one signature.
    
    ```sql
    -- single component fee structure
    fee = 0.000005
    ```
    Vote fees are not included in `gas_solana.tx_fees` and are instead included in `gas_solana.vote_fees`.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

We consider both `gas_solana.tx_fees` and `gas_solana.vote_fees` when calculating the total transaction fees for Solana in `metrics.gas_fees_daily`.

#### Bitcoin

Bitcoin uses a simple fee structure where each transaction has a fee paid to the miner. Miners pick the transactions with the highest fees to include in the next block.

```sql
-- Single component fee structure
fee = fee
```
