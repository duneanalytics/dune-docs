description: Understanding transactions as a foundational component of the Dune Index

**The Dune Index has been sunset.** The underlying methodology and queries remain accessible. See the [introduction page](/data-catalog/dune-index/introduction) for details on how to continue using this data.

## Overview

The transaction component of the Dune Index measures blockchain activity by counting transactions that transfer at least 1 USD in value. This filtered approach helps focus on meaningful economic activity while maintaining a simple, verifiable methodology.

## Methodology

The transaction metric employs a straightforward filtering approach:

1. Base Criteria
   - Count only transactions with transfers of $1 or more
   - Convert all token transfers to USD value at time of transaction
   - Include both native token and token contract transfers

2. Rationale
   - $1 threshold excludes dust transactions and spam
   - Low threshold maintains inclusivity of meaningful activity
   - Simple criteria enables consistent cross-chain comparison

3. Implementation
   - Track successful transfers only
   - Calculate USD value at transaction time
   - Aggregate across all supported token types

## Technical Considerations

Several factors influence transaction counting:

1. Value Calculation
   - Use time-weighted token prices
   - Account for token decimals and precision
   - Handle cases of missing price data

2. Cross-Chain Standardization
   - Apply consistent $1 threshold across networks
   - Account for different token value representations
   - Handle multi-token transactions appropriately

## Limitations

Understanding the metric's limitations is crucial:

1. Threshold Effects
   - May exclude some meaningful sub-$1 activity
   - Still includes some non-meaningful activity above $1
   - Value threshold is nominal, not inflation-adjusted

2. Technical Constraints
   - Requires reliable price data for all tokens
   - Must handle complex transaction types consistently
   - Network upgrades may affect transaction classification

## Usage Guidelines

When analyzing transaction data:

1. Trend Analysis
   - Focus on directional changes over time
   - Compare across similar time periods
   - Consider seasonal and cyclical patterns

2. Context
   - Use alongside other Dune Index components
   - Consider network-specific factors
   - Account for major protocol changes

The transaction count provides a foundational measure of blockchain adoption while the $1 threshold helps filter out noise, making it a valuable component of the Dune Index despite its inherent limitations.
