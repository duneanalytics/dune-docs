## What is Fuel?

Fuel is an operating system purpose-built for Ethereum Rollups. It implements improvements suggested to the Ethereum VM (EVM) for many years that couldn't be implemented due to the need to maintain backward compatibility, including parallel transaction execution and multiple native assets.

Fuel delivers unmatched processing capacity through its ability to execute transactions in parallel by using strict state access lists in the form of a UTXO model. With the FuelVM, Fuel full nodes identify the accounts a transaction touches, mapping out dependencies before execution.

## Key Features

- **Parallel Transaction Execution**: Fuel can execute transactions in parallel, significantly increasing throughput
- **UTXO Model**: Uses a strict state access list model for efficient transaction processing
- **Multiple Native Assets**: Supports multiple native assets natively
- **FuelVM**: A purpose-built virtual machine that improves upon the EVM
- **Sway Language**: A domain-specific language based on Rust for smart contract development
