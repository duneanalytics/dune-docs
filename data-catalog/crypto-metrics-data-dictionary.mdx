**Metrics Dictionary Notice**

This metrics dictionary provides blockchain analytics queries as starting points for analysis. Please note:

**General Information:**
- These queries are educational examples and may need customization
- Blockchain data can vary across different sources and time periods

**Best Practices:**
- Review and understand each query before using it
- Test on small datasets first
- Modify queries to fit your specific needs

These are learning resources and starting templates for your analysis.
