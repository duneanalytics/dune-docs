## Table description

This table contains information about all transactions on the Starknet blockchain, including both user-initiated and system transactions. Transactions are the actions that modify the state of the blockchain, such as transfers of tokens or the execution of smart contracts. Each transaction is uniquely identified and linked to the block in which it was included.

## Column Descriptions

import { ColumnDescriptions } from "/snippets/column-descriptions.mdx";

<ColumnDescriptions tableSchema="starknet" tableName="transactions" />

<Note>
- Prior to [v3 transactions upgrade](https://www.starknet.io/developers/roadmap/v3-transactions/), fees are denominated in `wei` as users pay gas with ETH. For transactions v3 and later, fees are denominated in `fri` as users pay gas with STRK. Hence here you can see two gas types of gas fields, one for `wei` and one for `fri`.     
- Starting with Starknet v0.13.1, Starknet distinguishes between blocks whose state diffs are sent to L1 as calldata and blocks whose state diffs are sent to L1 as blobs. The `l1_da_mode` property in the Starknet block header contains this information. Values possible are `BLOB` or `CALLDATA`.
- The `type` fields denotes [different types of transactions](https://docs.starknet.io/architecture-and-concepts/network-architecture/transactions/) supported by Starknet. Possible values are: `INVOKE`, `L1_HANDLER`, `DECLARE`, `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT`, and `DEPLOY`.
- The `fee_data_availability_mode` field denotes the storage domain of the account's balance from which fee will be charged. It can be one of 'L1' or 'L2'
- The `block_status` has possible values `ACCEPTED_ON_L1` or `ACCEPTED_ON_L2`. Read here to learn more about [different transaction status](https://docs.starknet.io/architecture-and-concepts/network-architecture/transaction-life-cycle/#transaction_status).
- The `actual_fee` has the actual fee paid for the transaction, to be used together with `actual_fee_unit`.
