## Table description

This table represents the blocks in the Starknet blockchain. A block is a collection of transactions, and is identified by a unique block identifier. Each block contains a timestamp and a reference to the previous block hash, forming a chain of blocks. The block structure is crucial for the blockchain's integrity and security, ensuring a verifiable and tamper-evident ledger.

<Note>
- Prior to [v3 transactions upgrade](https://www.starknet.io/developers/roadmap/v3-transactions/), fees are denominated in `wei` as users pay gas with ETH. For transactions v3 and later, fees are denominated in `fri` as users pay gas with STRK. Hence here you can see two gas types of gas fields, one for `wei` and one for `fri`.     
- Starting with Starknet v0.13.1, Starknet distinguishes between blocks whose state diffs are sent to L1 as calldata and blocks whose state diffs are sent to L1 as blobs. The `l1_da_mode` property in the Starknet block header contains this information. Values possible are `BLOB` or `CALLDATA`.
