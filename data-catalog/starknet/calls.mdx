## Column Descriptions

import { ColumnDescriptions } from "/snippets/column-descriptions.mdx";

<ColumnDescriptions tableSchema="starknet" tableName="calls" />

<Note>
- Prior to [v3 transactions upgrade](https://www.starknet.io/developers/roadmap/v3-transactions/), fees are denominated in `wei` as users pay gas with ETH. For transactions v3 and later, fees are denominated in `fri` as users pay gas with STRK. Hence here you can see two types of gas fields, one for `wei` and one for `fri`.     
- Starting with Starknet v0.13.1, Starknet distinguishes between blocks whose state diffs are sent to L1 as calldata and blocks whose state diffs are sent to L1 as blobs. The `l1_da_mode` property in the Starknet block header contains this information. Possible values are `BLOB` or `CALLDATA`.
- The `block_status` has possible values `ACCEPTED_ON_L1` or `ACCEPTED_ON_L2`. Read here to learn more about [different transaction status](https://docs.starknet.io/architecture-and-concepts/network-architecture/transaction-life-cycle/#transaction_status).
- The `transaction_type` field denotes [different types of transactions](https://docs.starknet.io/architecture-and-concepts/network-architecture/transactions/) supported by Starknet. Possible values are: `INVOKE`, `L1_HANDLER`, `DECLARE`, `DEPLOY_ACCOUNT`, and `DEPLOY`.
- The `call_type` field denotes what type of function call was invoked. Possible values are [`LIBRARY_CALL`](https://docs.starknet.io/architecture-and-concepts/smart-contracts/system-calls-cairo1/#library_call), `CALL`, or `DELEGATE` 
- `entry_point_type`: The type of entry point. Possible values include `EXTERNAL`, `L1_HANDLER`, `CONSTRUCTOR`
