## What is Flow?

Flow is a fast, decentralized, and developer-friendly blockchain designed for the next generation of apps, games, and digital assets. Flow features a unique multi-node architecture that enables high throughput while maintaining decentralization and security.

**On Dune, Flow data is available for both execution environments:**

- **Flow EVM** - Ethereum-compatible environment for Solidity developers
- **Flow Cadence** - Flow's native smart contract environment with resource-oriented programming

## Flow EVM vs Cadence: Key Differences

| Aspect | Flow EVM | Flow Cadence |
|--------|----------|--------------|
| **Smart Contract Language** | Solidity | Cadence |
| **Compatibility** | Full EVM equivalence | Native Flow |
| **Developer Tooling** | Ethereum toolchain (Hardhat, Foundry, etc.) | Flow CLI, Cadence tools |
| **Account Model** | EOA + Contract accounts | Resource-oriented accounts |
| **Gas Token** | FLOW | FLOW |
| **Interoperability** | Cross-VM bridge to Cadence | Cross-VM bridge to EVM |

Both environments share the same underlying Flow blockchain and use FLOW as the native gas token, enabling seamless cross-VM interactions.

## Flow EVM

Flow EVM is a fast EVM equivalent blockchain with low fees, making it an ideal **Ethereum alternative for apps** that need both performance and affordability. With EVM equivalency, Solidity developers can deploy existing contracts on Flow without rewriting code.

### EVM Key Features

- **EVM Equivalence**: Full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts and tooling
- **Ultra-Fast Performance**: Transaction throughput peaked to 2M daily transactions
- **Low Gas Fees**: Ultra-low cost gas fees with support for gasless experiences
- **MEV Resilience**: Robust design offering improved market efficiency and fairness
- **Cross-VM Integration**: Seamless token transfers between EVM and Cadence

## Flow Cadence

Flow Cadence is Flow's native smart contract environment using the resource-oriented Cadence programming language. It offers unique capabilities for digital ownership, NFTs, and complex on-chain logic.

### Cadence Key Features

- **Resource-Oriented Programming**: First-class digital ownership at the language level
- **Account Linking**: Advanced account abstraction enabling smooth user onboarding
- **Native NFT Support**: Purpose-built for digital collectibles and assets
- **Upgradeable Contracts**: Safe contract upgrade patterns
- **Multi-Role Node Architecture**: Heterogeneous node roles ensuring security
