## Table description
Extrinsics (aka "transactions") normally contain a signature, some data to describe if the extrinsic has passed some validity checks and a reference to the pallet and call that it is intended for. Extrinsics may be signed or unsigned. Some extrinsics have a complex structure, e.g. when using proxy or utility pallets, resulting in the top-level call initiating other calls involving other pallets.

This table is partitioned by `year`, `month`, `section`, and `method` for efficient querying. Common queries on the `extrinsics` table will typically filter on `block_time`, `section` and `method` and extract JSON encoded information from `params`. In many cases, an initial query on the `extrinsics` table is best developed on the calls table instead to properly capture how users often use proxy and utility constructs to interact with the Peaq chain.

Each extrinsic record includes the top-level call information (section and method), block and hash information, signer details, fee and weight, execution status, and call parameters.

## Column Descriptions

| **Column**        | **Description**                                                              | **Type**                              |
| ------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------- |
| **year**          | The year when the extrinsic was executed, used for partitioning.             | int                                   |
| **month**         | The month when the extrinsic was executed, used for partitioning.           | int                                   |
| **section**       | The pallet section (module) of the top-level call (e.g., "balances", "system"). | string                            |
| **method**        | The method name of the top-level call within the pallet section.            | string                                |
| **block_time**    | The timestamp when the block containing this extrinsic was created.         | timestamp                             |
| **block_number**  | The block number where this extrinsic was executed.                          | long                                  |
| **extrinsic_id**  | The unique identifier for the extrinsic record.                              | string                                |

| **block_hash**    | The hash of the block containing this extrinsic, in binary format.           | binary                                |
| **lifetime**      | The lifetime or validity period of the extrinsic, if applicable.             | string                                |
| **params**       | The call parameters in JSON format, containing the arguments passed to the call. | string                            |
| **fee**           | The fee charged for executing this extrinsic, in processed format.         | double                                |
| **weight**        | The computational weight consumed by this extrinsic.                         | long                                  |
| **signed**        | Indicates whether the extrinsic was signed by an account.                    | boolean                               |
| **signer_ss58**   | The SS58-encoded address of the account that signed the extrinsic, in human-readable format. | string                        |
| **signer_pub_key**| The public key of the account that signed the extrinsic, in binary format.   | binary                                |
| **status**        | Indicates whether the extrinsic execution was successful.                   | boolean                               |
| **_updated_at**   | The time when the extrinsic record was last updated.                         | timestamp                             |
| **_ingested_at**  | The time when the extrinsic data was ingested into the system.              | timestamp                             |
