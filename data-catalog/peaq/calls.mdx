## Table description
Compared to the `extrinsics` table, which only has a top-level call, the `calls` table represents _internal_ calls, including recursive internal calls of `proxy` and `utility` (batch) pallets, and provides detailed call arguments at each level of the call tree.

This table is partitioned by `year`, `month`, `call_section`, and `call_method` for efficient querying. Common queries on the `calls` table will typically filter on `block_time`, `call_section` and `call_method` and extract JSON encoded information from `call_args` or `call_args_def`.

Each call record includes information about the pallet section and method being called, the extrinsic it belongs to, call hierarchy (root/leaf), fee and weight information, signer details, and call arguments in both raw and decoded formats.
