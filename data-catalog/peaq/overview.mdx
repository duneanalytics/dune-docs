  </Card>
</CardGroup>

By leveraging parallelized block production, asynchronous backing, and agile core time, peaq currently handles up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). It is set to scale beyond 100,000 TPS after future upgrades, all while maintaining a minimum transaction cost of approximately $0.00025. peaq leverages the world's environmentally-friendliest blockchain architecture and leverages one of the highest Nakamoto Coefficients in the industry to ensure censorship resistance.

peaq offers a comprehensive suite of ready-to-use Modular DePIN and DePAI Functions, granting builders and machines essential core functionalities to leverage for seamless deployment. These include self-sovereign machine IDs, role-based access control, data verification, universal machine time, seamless machine payment processing, data storage, data indexing, AI agents, and more. All functions are accessible via the peaq SDK, allowing developers to deploy them with just ~15 lines of code.
