## Table description
Tracks account balance snapshots on the Peaq network, capturing the state of user assets at specific timestamps. This table is partitioned by `year`, `month`, and `day` for efficient querying.

Each record includes balance information in both processed (double) and raw (string) formats, allowing for precise balance tracking. The table tracks multiple balance types including free balances, reserved balances, and various frozen balance states (misc_frozen and frozen).

Accounts are identified using SS58 addresses (`address_ss58`) and public keys (`address_pubkey`), supporting both human-readable and binary address formats. The table also includes chain and asset metadata such as `symbol`, `chain_name`, `asset`, and `para_id` for multi-chain support.
