## Table description
Stores basic information about Peaq blocks, with one record per block, including the block hash and statistics on the number of extrinsics, events, and transfers contained in each block. This table is partitioned by `year`, `month`, and `day` for efficient querying.

Each block record includes metadata such as block number, specification version, relay chain block number, block hashes (hash, parent hash, state root, extrinsics root), block author information, and counts of various operations (extrinsics, events, transfers, traces).

## Column Descriptions

| **Column**            | **Description**                                                              | **Type**                              |
