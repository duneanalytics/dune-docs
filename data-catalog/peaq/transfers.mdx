## Table description
Stores complete ledger of asset transfers across the Peaq network, capturing the movement of tokens between accounts. This table is partitioned by `year`, `month`, and `day` for efficient querying.

Each transfer record includes information about the sender and recipient (in both SS58 and public key formats), the asset being transferred, the amount in both processed (double) and raw (decimal) formats, and the event and extrinsic that triggered the transfer.
