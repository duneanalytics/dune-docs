## Table description
Records specific changes that occur in the ledger as a result of successful operations, but are not necessarily directly reflected in the ledger or history, as transactions and operations are.

Operations are objects that represent a desired change to the ledger: payments, offers to exchange currency, changes made to account options, etc. Operations are submitted to the Stellar network grouped in a Transaction. Each of Stellarâ€™s operations have a unique operation object.
