## What is Stellar?

Stellar is an open-source, decentralized blockchain designed for fast, low-cost financial transactions. Built around the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a unique proof-of-agreement (PoA) mechanism, Stellar focuses on facilitating cross-border payments, asset issuance, and decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. Stellar’s network prioritizes energy efficiency and speed, with transactions confirmed within 5 seconds and the network capable of processing up to 1,000 operations per ledger.

Stellar's native token, the lumen (XLM), plays a key role in maintaining the network’s health by ensuring account activity and discouraging spam through a small transaction fee and minimum balance requirement.

## Key Concepts of Stellar

Stellar’s blockchain architecture and mechanisms are designed for high-speed financial transactions and asset transfers, underpinned by a few critical components that set it apart from other blockchain platforms.

### **Ledger Structure**
Stellar’s blockchain operates using ledgers, similar to blocks on other blockchains. A ledger records the state of accounts, balances, smart contracts, and other relevant data. Each ledger contains a ledger header, summarizing essential metadata such as the sequence number, transaction fees, and validator signatures.


### **Proof-of-Agreement Consensus**
Stellar uses the Stellar Consensus Protocol (SCP), a proof-of-agreement consensus that enables rapid transaction processing while ensuring decentralization. Unlike proof-of-work (PoW) or proof-of-stake (PoS) models, SCP relies on trusted nodes reaching a consensus through agreement, making Stellar energy-efficient and fast.

### **Accounts and Trustlines**
Stellar accounts hold **lumen (XLM)** and other token balances via **trustlines**. A trustline is an established link between a user account and a token issuer, allowing the user to hold, send, or receive tokens other than lumens. While **accounts** store native lumens, **trustlines** track the balances of other tokens, including popular assets like USDC and USDT.

### **Token Issuance**
One of Stellar’s most powerful features is its support for **asset issuance**. Developers can create tokenized assets that represent fiat currencies, commodities, or other real-world value. These assets can be traded on Stellar’s native decentralized exchange (DEX), making Stellar an ideal platform for borderless payments and asset transfers.

### **Transaction Lifecycle & Fees**
Each Stellar transaction is an atomic operation that can involve multiple **operations**, such as payments, creating accounts, or managing offers on the DEX. Fees are minimal, with the current minimum per-transaction fee being 0.00001 XLM. Stellar’s architecture ensures efficient cross-border transactions with a finality time of around 5 seconds.

### **Smart Contracts**
Stellar supports smart contracts through a combination of **operations** and **contract data** stored on the ledger. Smart contracts can define various on-chain actions, such as token management or enforcing custom rules for transactions. Stellar's smart contract execution is energy-efficient, focusing on lightweight operations for scalability.

## Stellar Data on Dune

Stellar blockchain data is categorized into traditional time series tables (e.g., **history_** tables for actions affecting the state of the ledger) and **ledger state** tables (e.g., **accounts**, representing the current state). This division allows users to explore historical actions and current ledger state for deeper analysis. Here are the Stellar tables available on Dune:
