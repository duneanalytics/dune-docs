## Table description

This table represents the transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. A transaction is a transfer of Bitcoin value that is broadcast to the network and collected into blocks. A transaction typically references previous transaction outputs as new transaction inputs and dedicates all input Bitcoin values to new outputs. Transactions are not encrypted, so it is possible to browse and view every transaction ever collected into a block.

### Struct definitions

Within several of these columns is a data type of STRUCT which allows for representing nested hierarchical data and has key-value pairs. It's similar to a dictionary in Python and can be used to group fields together to make them more accessible.

Note that you can work with these columns with the syntax `input[1].witness_data[2]` or `input[3].script_pub_key.address` depending on lengths of arrays within each value. It is an `array(row(map))` type, and while it looks like just an array in the returned table - it is more than that!
