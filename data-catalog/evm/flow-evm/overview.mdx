## What is Flow EVM?

Flow EVM is a fast EVM equivalent blockchain with low fees, making it an ideal **Ethereum alternative for apps** that need both performance and affordability. With EVM equivalency, Solidity developers can deploy existing contracts on Flow without rewriting code, instantly gaining access to Flow's ultra-fast transactions, low costs, and mainstream scalability. Builders can tap into Flow's unique IPs and large user base with no implementation risk.

## Key Features

- **EVM Equivalence**: Full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts and tooling
- **Ultra-Fast Performance**: Transaction throughput peaked to 2M daily transactions during 2023
- **Low Gas Fees**: Ultra-low cost gas fees with support for gasless experiences through sponsored transactions
- **MEV Resilience**: Robust design offering improved market efficiency, fairness, and trust for DeFi apps
- **Cross-VM Integration**: Seamless token transfers between EVM and Cadence environments
- **Account Linking**: Advanced account abstraction model enabling smooth user onboarding

## Performance & Scalability

- **Daily Transaction Volume**: Sustained similar average transaction volume as Ethereum
- **Scalability**: Currently scalable to 5x more transactions with further performance optimizations
- **State Space**: Extensible to petabyte scale for onchain application data storage
- **Multi-Node Architecture**: Innovative distributed consensus with flexible transaction model
- **Parallel Execution**: Further throughput optimization capabilities coming soon

## Technical Architecture

- **EVM Transactions**: Composed and executed within Cadence transactions
- **Native VM Token Bridge**: Instant cross-VM token transfers in single atomic transactions
- **Shared Gas Token**: Both EVM and Cadence environments use FLOW as gas
- **Hybrid Capabilities**: Expand EVM limitations using Cadence's powerful account model
- **Multi-Role Node Architecture**: Heterogeneous node roles ensuring MEV resilience

## Ecosystem Highlights

- Seamless integration for Ethereum developers with existing toolchain
- Best-in-class UX through Account Linking and account abstraction
- Support for both EVM and Cadence smart contract environments
- Novel use-cases through VM integration patterns
- Strong economic disincentives for collusion and frontrunning attacks
