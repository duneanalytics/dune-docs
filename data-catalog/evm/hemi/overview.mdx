## What is Hemi?

Hemi is a modular Layer-2 protocol that provides superior scaling, security, and interoperability by combining the power of Bitcoin and Ethereum. Unlike other projects that treat Bitcoin and Ethereum as separate ecosystem silos, Hemi views them as components of a single supernetwork, unlocking new levels of programmability, portability, and potential.

## Key Features

- **Bitcoin-Ethereum Integration**: Combines Bitcoin and Ethereum as components of a supernetwork
- **Hemi Virtual Machine (hVM)**: Incorporates a full Bitcoin node within an Ethereum Virtual Machine
- **Proof-of-Proof (PoP) Consensus**: Ensures transactions surpass Bitcoin's security level in hours
- **Trustless Cross-chain Portability**: Secure asset transfers between Hemi and other chains via "Tunnels"
- **Bitcoin Programmability**: Smart contracts with granular indexed views of Bitcoin state
- **Extensibility**: Allows external projects to create chains secured by Hemi's technology

## Ecosystem Highlights

- Modular Layer-2 protocol for superior scaling and security
- Full integration of Bitcoin and Ethereum ecosystems
- Advanced on-chain functionalities including routing, time-lock, and password protection
- Bitcoin-Security-as-a-Service capabilities
- Enhanced dual-chain interoperability and asset handling
