World Chain is a blockchain for humans, designed to empower developers with unique primitives and enable never-before-seen applications. By offering free gas fees to all verified humans, native mobile distribution through mini apps, and sybil resistance via World ID, World Chain is set to revolutionize the blockchain landscape for a global audience.

**Human-Centric Primitives:**
World Chain provides a set of powerful tools for developers:
- **Free Gas for Verified Humans:** Eliminating transaction fees for verified users.
- **Native Mobile Mini Apps:** Seamlessly distribute mini apps to all World App users, unlocking new opportunities for global reach and engagement.
- **Sybil Resistance:** Built-in World ID technology ensures that developers can trust the unique identity of their users, reducing fraud and increasing transparency.

**Scalable and Decentralized:**
World Chain is **built on the Superchain**, a horizontally scalable network of OP Chains that share security, governance, and a communication layer. By leveraging the OP Stack, World Chain benefits from decentralized scalability while maintaining ease of integration for developers.

**Mini Apps:**
World Chain supports mini apps, allowing third-party developers to create native-like applications within World App. This opens the door to global payments, sign-in with Ethereum, and other crypto transactions. Developers can access a rapidly growing user network and monetize via WLD and USDC through mini apps.

**Worldcoin and World ID:**
- **Worldcoin Token (WLD):** The first token to be freely distributed globally for both utility and governance, rewarding users just for being verified as unique individuals.
- **World ID:** A privacy-preserving digital identity that proves you are a real and unique person, forming the foundation for sybil-resistant applications and secure digital interactions.
