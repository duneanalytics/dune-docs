## Table description

Contains all messages submitted to the blockchain. Each row represents one message, so there may be repeated `tx_id` if the transaction contains multiple messages.

<Tip>
On execution, transactions from Cosmos emit data in two formats:
- Messages (`sei.cosmos_tx_messages`): These provide a high-level, readable summary of actions, such as "send money" or "execute contract." They are easier to understand and track transaction types.
- Events (`sei.cosmos_message_events`): These capture detailed, low-level changes at the chain level, including underlying blockchain modifications that may not always be directly related to state changes.
- Use Messages for a general overview and Events when you need detailed insights. The two tables are complementary.
