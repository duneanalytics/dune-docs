## What is Sei?

Sei is a Layer-1 blockchain optimized for trading and decentralized finance (DeFi). It combines the strengths of Solana and Ethereum by implementing a fast parallelized EVM chain, providing a hyper-optimized execution layer that benefits from the tooling and mindshare around the EVM.

<Warning>
Sei is a Cosmos chain with EVM modules added in the [v2 upgrade](https://www.mintscan.io/sei/proposals/55). Dune indexes the EVM data separately from the Cosmos data. As such, data latency between the two can be expected.
</Warning>

<Tip>
- Sei (v1) was originally a Cosmos chain. On May 20, 2024, a proposal to [upgrade Sei (v2) to include EVM support](https://www.mintscan.io/sei/proposals/55) was passed. Consequently, on May 27, 2024, Sei upgraded to [v2 with EVM support](https://github.com/sei-protocol/sei-chain/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md#v552).
- Dune indexes the EVM component of Sei directly from RPC providers, supporting standard EVM chain decoding capabilities.
- For Cosmos data, Dune partners with a data provider, and these tables and schemas can be found in the [Cosmos Data](#cosmos-data) section.
- The EVM and Cosmos components share the same consensus mechanism, validated by the same validators, but they operate independently with interoperability features.
- Interoperability between EVM and Cosmos relies on [EVM Precompiles](https://www.docs.sei.io/dev-interoperability/precompiles/addr) and [Pointer Contracts](https://www.docs.sei.io/dev-interoperability/pointer-contracts). If these do not emit events, it may result in data gaps.
- Dune's EVM data for Sei starts from the v2 upgrade at [block height 79,123,881](https://seitrace.com/block/79123881).

### Parallelization

Parallelization allows Sei to process multiple independent transactions simultaneously, leveraging modern hardware capabilities for enhanced performance.

### Sei Optimizations

Sei introduces four major innovations:

1. **Twin Turbo Consensus**: This feature allows Sei to reach the fastest time to finality of any blockchain at 400ms, unlocking web2-like experiences for applications.
2. **Optimistic Parallelization**: This feature allows developers to unlock parallel processing for their Ethereum applications, with no additional work.
3. **SeiDB**: This major upgrade allows Sei to handle the much higher rate of data storage, reads and writes which become extremely important for a high-performance blockchain.
4. **Interoperable EVM**: This allows existing developers in the Ethereum ecosystem to deploy their applications, tooling and infrastructure to Sei with no changes, while benefiting from the 100x performance improvements offered by Sei.

### Performance Metrics

- **Time to Finality**: 400 milliseconds
- **Transactions per Second**: 5,030 (12,500 theoretical max)

### Virtual Machine Interoperability

Sei supports both EVM and CosmWasm smart contracts in different execution environments. It introduces interoperability features, such as precompiled EVM contracts and Pointer Contracts, to enable smooth interactions between both environments.

### Cosmos Data

<Tip>
Timestamp is only available on block level tables (e.g. `sei.cosmos_blocks`) with field `block_timestamp`, so you need to do an inner join on `block_height` to get timestamp to other tables.
