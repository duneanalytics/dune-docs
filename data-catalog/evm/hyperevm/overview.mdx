## What is HyperEVM?

HyperEVM is the EVM-compatible layer of the Hyperliquid blockchain, which features a dual-block architecture with HyperCore and HyperEVM. The HyperEVM is not a separate chain, but rather secured by the same HyperBFT consensus as HyperCore, allowing it to interact directly with HyperCore's spot and perpetual order books.

## Key Features

- **Dual-Block Architecture**: Combines HyperCore (for trading) and HyperEVM (for smart contracts)
- **EVM-Compatible**: Full compatibility with Ethereum smart contracts and tooling
- **Direct Order Book Access**: Smart contracts can read prices and execute trades directly on HyperCore
- **Permissionless Asset Deployment**: Projects can deploy ERC20 contracts and corresponding spot assets
- **Unified State**: No bridging risk between HyperCore and HyperEVM
- **Mature Liquidity**: Access to established, liquid onchain order books
- **Captive Audience**: Built-in user base excited about onchain finance

## Technical Capabilities

- **Read Precompiles**: Smart contracts can read prices directly from HyperCore order books
- **Write System Contracts**: Contracts can send orders directly to HyperCore order books
- **Protocolized Liquidations**: Lending protocols can implement automated liquidations
- **Native Token Integration**: Seamless connection between HyperEVM contracts and HyperCore trading

## Use Cases

- **DeFi Protocols**: Lending, borrowing, and automated trading strategies
- **Token Projects**: Permissionless listing and trading of new assets
- **Trading Bots**: Direct access to order books for algorithmic trading
- **Cross-Protocol Integration**: Seamless interaction between different DeFi applications

## Current Status

HyperEVM is currently in alpha stage with a gradual roll-out approach to ensure:
- Equal access for all developers (no insiders)
- Safe system upgrades for high-volume trading
- Live iteration based on user feedback

## Data on Dune

We currently don't support traces yet for hyperEVM so compared to usual EVM support we will not have:
- Traces
- Traces_decoded
- "Enable bytecode matching" decoding feature
- "Decode other contracts created by the same factory" decoding feature
