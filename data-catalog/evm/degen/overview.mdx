Degen, an ERC-20 token launched in January 2024, has reshaped the Farcaster ecosystem by enabling Casters to reward others with DEGEN for posting quality content. Our points system recognizes unique posts and comments, effectively bridging the gap between online contributions and real-world value.

Degen has launched a layer3 solution that settles transactions on the base network. This solution is designed to provide a more efficient and scalable way to settle transactions related to $degen.
Degen Chain uses Arbitrum Orbit for rollups, Base for transaction settlements, and Arbitrum AnyTrust for data availability.
