## What is Mezo?

Mezo is the onchain Bitcoin banking platform owned by its users. Users can access self-service Bitcoin finance without interacting with loan officers, undergoing credit checks, or observing operational hours. It's just you, your Bitcoin, and permissionless access to financial services 24/7.

Mezo eliminates traditional banking middlemen, giving you the power to manage your finances intelligently on your own terms. The platform is built on tBTC, the most battle-tested decentralized Bitcoin bridge with 24k+ BTC bridged since 2020.

## Key Features and Advantages

### Flagship Feature: Fixed Rate Bitcoin Loans

**MUSD: Bitcoin-Backed Money with Complete Autonomy**

Deposit Bitcoin as collateral, mint MUSD (a dollar-pegged stablecoin), and use it however you need. Your Bitcoin stays yours while MUSD provides you with instant liquidity. Fixed rates start as low as 1% and stay fixed for the entire life of the loan.

This is self-service banking with complete autonomy. Unlike any traditional banking experience, there are no minimum payments, set repayment schedules, or penalties for early repayment. Close your position tomorrow or keep it open for years.
