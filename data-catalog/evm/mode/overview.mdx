Mode is the Modular DeFi Layer 2 building the Superchain alongside Optimism. The goal of Mode is to empower developers and users to grow an ecosystem of world-class applications and be directly rewarded for their contribution.

Mode builds new onchain economic systems to enable developers to scale their applications and provide higher yields for users. 

**Empowering Developers and Users:**
Mode offers hands-on support to scale your application and earn predictable revenue through sequencer fee sharing and developer airdrops. It encourages building experimental DeFi projects on Mode, making it a thriving environment for innovation.

**The Onchain Cooperative:**
Mode is committed to rewarding developers who grow the Mode ecosystem via the following mechanisms:

- **Sequencer Fee Sharing:** Mode incorporates contract revenue-sharing incentives at the protocol layer. Applications and users that scale the Mode blockchain are motivated to work together and directly receive a proportion of network sequencer profits.
- **Developer Airdrops:** Mode will run a series of developer airdrops which reward developers for their contributions to the Mode ecosystem. A significant portion of MODE is available for developers.
- **Optimism's RPG Funding:** All developers building open-source apps and tools on Mode can apply for Optimism's $2b RPG Funding program. The Mode team will assist developers with their applications.

**Low Fees:**
Mode has implemented Optimism's Bedrock upgrade, significantly reducing fees to be over 95% less than Ethereum. This makes it fast and cheap to use, great for end-user dApps.

**Contributing to the Superchain:**
Mode is powered by the OP Stack, in collaboration with Optimism. We aim to contribute to growing Optimism's Superchain ecosystem as the main DeFi hub.
