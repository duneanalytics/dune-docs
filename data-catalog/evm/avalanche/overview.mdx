Avalanche C-Chain is a Layer 1 blockchain that functions as part of the Avalanche network, offering high throughput and compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This compatibility enables developers to migrate Ethereum dApps to Avalanche with minimal changes, utilizing the same Solidity programming language.

The core innovation of Avalanche C-Chain is its consensus mechanism, which combines classical consensus and Nakamoto consensus techniques to deliver rapid transaction finality and robust security. This design allows the C-Chain to process transactions faster and at lower costs compared to traditional blockchain networks.

$Avax is used as the primary utility token on the Avalanche C-Chain for transaction fees. However, the unique aspects of Avalanche's architecture provide enhanced scalability, making it a popular choice for developers seeking efficient and cost-effective blockchain solutions.

Dune provides extensive datasets for Avalanche C-Chain, offering detailed insights into transactions, smart contract interactions, and overall network health.
