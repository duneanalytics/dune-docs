## What is MegaETH?

MegaETH is an EVM-compatible blockchain built to deliver **real-time performance**, aiming for millisecond-level responsiveness while sustaining high throughput and substantial compute capacity. The goal is to push performance toward hardware limits so developers can build applications with fast feedback loops and high update rates.

## Key Features

- **Real-time execution**: Process transactions as they arrive and publish state updates in real time.
- **High throughput + compute**: Designed to support demanding on-chain applications that are bottlenecked by gas-per-second and compute limits on typical EVM chains.
- **Node specialization**: Uses specialized node roles (sequencers, provers, full nodes, replica nodes) to reduce consensus/execution overhead while preserving verifiability.
- **EVM compatibility**: Supports the EVM environment so existing Ethereum tooling and contracts can be used.
- **Security via base layers**: Delegates security and censorship-resistance constraints to base layers such as Ethereum and EigenDA, enabling a broader performance optimization design space.
