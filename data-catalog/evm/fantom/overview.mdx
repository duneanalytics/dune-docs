Fantom is a high-performance, scalable, and secure smart-contract platform that is designed to overcome the limitations of previous generation blockchain platforms. Fantom is unique in its use of a directed acyclic graph (DAG) architecture, which allows for asynchronous confirmation of transactions, resulting in high throughput and minimal transaction costs.

The network uses a bespoke consensus algorithm called Lachesis, which ensures transactions are confirmed within 1-2 seconds, significantly improving the user experience and efficiency for decentralized applications (dApps) running on the platform.

**High Throughput and Low Cost:**
Fantom’s DAG architecture enables unparalleled transaction speed and drastically reduced costs, making it an ideal platform for developers looking to build scalable dApps.

**Developer-Friendly:**
Fantom is fully compatible with Ethereum, allowing developers to deploy Ethereum-based applications quickly and seamlessly using existing tools and languages like Solidity.

**Ecosystem Growth:**
Fantom supports a growing ecosystem of decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFT platforms, and other blockchain projects, fostering innovation and new developments within its network.
