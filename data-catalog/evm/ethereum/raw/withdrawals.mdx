description: Description of the ethereum.withdrawals table on Dune
---

<Note>Dune does not have beacon chain data yet. This table introduces the action of withdrawing from the beacon chain only.  </Note>


The [Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP) 4895](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-4895) introduces a system-level "operation" to support validator withdrawals that are "pushed" from the beacon chain to the EVM.

 Withdrawals are represented as a new type of object in the execution payload, called an "operation", that cleanly separates this "system-level" operation from regular transactions. Withdrawals provide key information from the consensus layer such as a monotonically increasing index, validator index, recipient address, and the amount of ether given in Gwei.

 Using this table you can observe beacon chain withdrawals.

## How to work with this table

In order to connect deposits and withdrawals, we must identify the ``validator_index`` of unique depositors. Since Dune doesn't have beacon chain data yet, we have to rely on a workaround using a query to obtain a list of valid and active deposits from the Ethereum deposit contract.

This [query](https://dune.com/queries/2364548) returns a list of valid and active deposits, which we can use to identify the ``validator_index`` of unique depositors. We can use this query to match the ``validator_index`` of depositors with the ``validator_index`` of withdrawers in the withdrawals table.

The Query is manually maintained and therefore may not always be up to date, but most historical data is available.
