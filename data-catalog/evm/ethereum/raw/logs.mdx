## Table Description

The `logs` table represents the logs generated by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) when a contract is executed. Logs are a way to store data on the blockchain. Logs originate from  events that occur during the execution of a smart contract. A log consists of: 
- topic list: a list of 0 to 4 32-byte data topics. `Topic0` is the hash of the signature of the event (indexed), and the remaining topics are indexed parameters of the event.
- data: contains non-indexed data.

This is the raw version of this table, for decoded event logs, see the [decoded logs](/data-catalog/evm/ethereum/decoded/event-logs) section.
