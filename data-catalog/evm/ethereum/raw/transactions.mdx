## Table Description

The `transactions` table contains information about all transactions on the Ethereum blockchain. Each row represents a single transaction and includes information such as block number, hash, timestamp, sender, recipient, value, gas, gas price, and more. 
Transactions are the fundamental unit of interaction with the Ethereum blockchain. Transactions are created by users and are used to send value, deploy smart contracts, and interact with smart contracts.

This is the raw version of this table, for decoded transaction calls, see the [call tables](/data-catalog/evm/ethereum/decoded/call-tables) section.
