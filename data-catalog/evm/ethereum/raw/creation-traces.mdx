## Table Description

The `creation_traces` table contains information about the creation of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This includes the address of the contract, the address of the creator, the block number at which the contract was created, the transaction hash, and the contract's bytecode. This table is useful for understanding the deployment of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.

This table is a subset of the `traces` table, which contains information about all traces on the Ethereum blockchain. The `creation_traces` table is filtered to only include traces that create new smart contracts. The filter for this is `type` = `create`.

## Examples

### Show the creation of a specific smart contract

```sql
select * from ethereum.creation_traces
where contract_address = '0x06012c8cf97bead5deae237070f9587f8e7a266d'
```

### Show the creation of smart contracts by a specific creator

```sql
select * from ethereum.creation_traces
where "from" = '0x0d4a11d5eeaac28ec3f61d100da81f6a1b65c9d6'
```

### Show the creation of smart contracts in the last 10 days

```sql
select 
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as day,
    count(*)
from ethereum.creation_traces
group by 1
order by 1 desc
limit 10
