Ethereum is a decentralized, open-source blockchain system that features its own cryptocurrency, Ether. It is a platform for numerous decentralized applications (dApps), including everything from financial tools to games and complex databases. Ethereum is well-known for its flexibility and its pioneering role in the introduction and use of smart contracts, which are self-executing contracts with the terms of the agreement directly written into code.

The network supports a broad range of applications due to its general-purpose nature, and it operates on a proof-of-stake consensus mechanism, enhancing its scalability and energy efficiency compared to earlier proof-of-work systems.

**Versatility and Developer Support:**
Ethereum supports the creation of a wide variety of applications beyond simple transactions. This includes decentralized finance (DeFi) applications, NFTs, and more, supported by a robust development toolkit and a strong global community.

**Smart Contract Functionality:**
Ethereum's use of smart contracts automates enforcement, management, performance, and payment â€” they execute automatically when conditions are met.
