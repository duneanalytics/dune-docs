Gnosis Chain is a Layer 2 scaling solution designed for Ethereum, focusing on creating a low-cost, high-efficiency platform for decentralized applications (dApps). Formerly known as xDai Chain, Gnosis Chain emphasizes predictability in transaction costs, which are paid in the native stablecoin, xDAI.

This platform uses a unique consensus mechanism called POSDAO, which is a Proof of Stake system that provides enhanced security and scalability while supporting environmental sustainability. Gnosis Chain is compatible with Ethereum, allowing Ethereum assets and projects to transition smoothly without the need for code changes.

**Cost Efficiency and Predictability:**
Transaction costs on Gnosis Chain are highly predictable, making it an attractive platform for developers and businesses that require consistent budgeting for blockchain operations.

**Ethereum Compatibility:**
Full compatibility with Ethereum ensures that developers can leverage existing tools and infrastructures to deploy and manage their applications on Gnosis Chain with minimal adjustments.
