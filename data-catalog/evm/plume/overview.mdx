# Plume

Plume is a public, EVM-compatible blockchain built for the next evolution of Real World Assets (RWAs). We're not just tokenizing assets — we're creating a seamless way to use them like crypto: stake, swap, lend, borrow, loop, and more.

By integrating institutional-grade assets with decentralized finance (DeFi) tools, Plume makes traditionally inaccessible assets — like private credit, ETFs, commodities — **permissionless, composable, and a click away.**

## Key Features

- **EVM Compatibility**: Plume is fully compatible with Ethereum Virtual Machine, making it easy for developers to port their existing Ethereum applications.
- **RWA Integration**: Designed specifically for Real World Assets (RWAs), enabling tokenization and trading of traditional financial instruments.
- **DeFi Ready**: Built-in support for staking, swapping, lending, borrowing, and other DeFi operations.
- **Institutional Grade**: Partnerships with major institutions, distribution partners, and asset managers.
- **Scalable**: Testnet success with 18 million wallets and 280 million transactions.

## Ecosystem

Plume has over 200 protocols onboarded and growing, with a focus on bringing real-world assets onchain. The platform enables:

- Access to assets previously out of reach
- Staking stablecoins to earn yield from major institutions
- Trading and collateralization of RWAs
- Integration with lending protocols
- Creation of new structured products
