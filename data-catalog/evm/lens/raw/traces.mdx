<Warning> 
You may see duplicate records in the `traces` table for the Lens chain. This is not a bug, but a result of trace calls appearing twice within the same transaction. These consecutive calls—an outer and an inner call—are identical except for their gas values. They share the same `from`, `to`, `input`, `output`, `success`, and `value` fields.
</Warning>
