## What is Taiko?

Taiko is a decentralized, Ethereum-equivalent ZK-Rollup that provides a seamless and secure scaling solution for Ethereum. Built with the Taiko Alethia Protocol, it offers full EVM compatibility while maintaining the security and decentralization of Ethereum through zero-knowledge proofs.

## Key Features

- **Ethereum-Equivalent**: Full EVM compatibility with no modifications required
- **ZK-Rollup Technology**: Secure scaling through zero-knowledge proofs
- **Decentralized**: Maintains Ethereum's security and decentralization principles
- **High Performance**: Significantly higher throughput than Ethereum mainnet
- **Gas Efficiency**: Reduced transaction costs while maintaining security

## Ecosystem Highlights

- Based on the Taiko Alethia Protocol for secure and efficient scaling
- Full compatibility with existing Ethereum tools and infrastructure
- Decentralized sequencer network for enhanced security
- Support for all Ethereum smart contracts and dApps
- Advanced ZK-proof generation for transaction validation
