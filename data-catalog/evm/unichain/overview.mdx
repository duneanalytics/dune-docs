Base is a secure, low-cost, builder-friendly Ethereum Layer 2 solution incubated by Coinbase. It is designed to onboard the next billion users to the blockchain, emphasizing ease of use and accessibility for a global audience. The platform aims for progressive decentralization over the years, underlining its commitment to an open, global cryptoeconomy.

As an Ethereum L2, Base offers the security, stability, and scalability necessary to support your onchain applications. Developers can deploy any EVM-compatible codebase and smoothly transition users and assets from Ethereum L1, Coinbase, and other compatible chains.

**Big Features, Small Fees:**
Base provides an Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) environment at significantly lower costs. It introduces early access to new Ethereum features such as Account Abstraction (ERC4337), developer-friendly APIs for gasless transactions, and advanced smart contract wallets.

**Open Source Commitment:**
Built on the MIT-licensed OP Stack in collaboration with Optimism, Base contributes as the second Core Development team to ensure the OP Stack remains a public good accessible to all.

**Scaled by Coinbase:**
Base leverages Coinbase's robust infrastructure to offer decentralized apps enhanced product integration, straightforward fiat onramps, and access to a vast network of millions of verified users within the Coinbase ecosystem.
