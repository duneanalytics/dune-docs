Unichain is a DeFi-native Ethereum Layer 2 solution designed to be the home for cross-chain liquidity. It aims to revolutionize DeFi by providing the fastest, most cost-effective Layer 2 network for uniting fragmented blockchain ecosystems.

**Key Features:**

**Instant Transactions:**
Unichain launches with 1-second block times, with plans to achieve 250ms block times. This reduced latency significantly improves market efficiency by increasing arbitrage frequency and reducing MEV impact.

**Cost-Effective & Decentralized:**
Built to leverage Ethereum's scaling roadmap, Unichain reduces transaction costs by approximately 95% in the short term, with further reductions expected over time. While utilizing a single sequencer for efficiency, it enhances decentralization through full node block verification.

**Cross-Chain Liquidity:**
As part of the Superchain ecosystem, Unichain supports native interoperability across dozens of chains, making it seamless to access liquidity regardless of users' origin chains. Uniswap Labs continues to pioneer standards for seamless cross-chain interoperability.
