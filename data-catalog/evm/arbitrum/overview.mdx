Arbitrum One is a Layer 2 scaling solution built on Ethereum that utilizes optimistic rollups to enhance scalability and reduce costs while maintaining compatibility with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). This allows developers to deploy their existing Solidity smart contracts on Arbitrum without any modifications.

At the heart of Arbitrum One's technology is its unique rollup solution, which batches multiple transactions into a single rollup block. This technique dramatically increases throughput and decreases the transaction costs, all while leveraging the underlying security of the Ethereum mainnet.

The primary utility token of Arbitrum One is Ether, which is used for paying transaction fees. Unlike traditional Layer 1 solutions, Arbitrum One offers a seamless extension of Ethereum, enhancing its scalability and efficiency without compromising on security or decentralization.

Dune provides extensive datasets for Arbitrum One, covering various aspects such as event logs, transactions, blocks, and token movements. These datasets provide valuable insights into network performance, user behavior, and smart contract functionality.
