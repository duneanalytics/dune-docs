## What is Story?

Story is the world's IP blockchain - a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain designed specifically for intellectual property. You can register your IP on-chain and add usage terms to it in seconds, massively lowering the barrier to the currently complex & antiquated legal system for IP.

By making IP programmable on the blockchain, it becomes a transparent & decentralized global IP repository where AI agents (or any other software) and humans alike can transact on & monetize IP with a simple API call.

## Key Features and Advantages

### The World's IP Blockchain

Story Network is a purpose-built layer 1 blockchain achieving the best of EVM and Cosmos SDK. It is 100% EVM-compatible alongside deep execution layer optimizations to support graph data structures, purpose-built for handling complex data structures like IP quickly and cost-efficiently.

### Proof-of-Creativity Protocol

The "Proof-of-Creativity" Protocol, made up of smart contracts written in Solidity, are natively deployed on Story Network and allow anyone to onramp IP to Story.

- **IP Assets**: Creators register their IP as IP Assets on Story. IP could be an image, a song, an RWA, AI training data, or anything in-between.
- **Modules**: You use Modules to interact with IP Assets. For example:
  - **Licensing Module**: Enforcing proper usage of your IP
  - **Royalty Module**: Paying & claiming revenue
  - **Dispute Module**: Disputing infringing IP
- **Ownership**: Each IP Asset has an associated ERC721 NFT, which represents ownership over the IP. This means IP ownership can be bought & sold.
- **IPFi**: The licenses minted from an IP are also ERC721 NFTs, meaning you can buy & sell the rights to use an IP under certain terms, unlocking a new realm of IP Finance.

### Programmable IP License (PIL)

Although on-chain, an IP's usage terms and minted licenses are enforced by an off-chain legal contract called the Programmable IP License (PIL). The PIL allows anyone to offramp tokenized IP on Story into the "real world" legal system and outlines real legal terms for how creators can remix, monetize, and create derivatives of their IP.

### Network Specifications

- **Technology Stack**: EVM-compatible Layer 1 with Cosmos SDK
- **Gas Token**: $IP
- **Network Type**: EVM-compatible Layer 1
- **Consensus**: CometBFT-based consensus layer for fast finality and cheap transactions
- **Optimizations**: Precompiled primitives to traverse complex data structures like IP graphs within seconds at marginal costs

### Developer Tools & Infrastructure

- **Full EVM Compatibility**: Support for standard Ethereum development tools
- **Smart Contract Development**: Solidity smart contracts
- **Graph Data Structures**: Purpose-built for handling complex IP data structures
- **Infrastructure**:
  - Cross-chain bridges (Stargate, deBridge, Orbiter Finance)
  - Stablecoin support (bridged USDC.e)
  - Wallet support (MetaMask, OKX, and other EVM-based wallets)
