Shape is the chain for creators, built on top of Ethereum. It is an EVM equivalent Layer 2 scaling solution that inherits its security directly from Ethereum, keeping the networks intrinsically linked forever.

**Chain for Creators with Gasback:**
As a creator on Shape, you can claim back 80% of sequencer fees users spend interacting with your contracts. This includes contracts you build yourself, contracts you acquire ownership of, and contracts that you deploy through other platforms.

**EVM Equivalent:**
Shape is fully EVM equivalent, providing the same creator experience as on Ethereum, just at a fraction of the cost. This enables developers to deploy existing smart contracts and dApps without the need for extensive modifications.

**Secure, Stable & Scalable:**
Shape inherits its security directly from Ethereum and prioritizes stability and scalability, utilizing Alchemy and Optimism as key infrastructure partners to help achieve and maintain these states.

**Part of the Superchain:**
Shape is a member of the Superchain, which unlocks a range of further benefits for the entire ecosystem - including ongoing network-level cooperation, funding of public goods, and additional builder incentives on Shape.
