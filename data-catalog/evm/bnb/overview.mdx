BNB Chain is a high-performance blockchain network developed by Binance that supports the creation and functionality of decentralized applications (dApps). It is designed to provide scalability and high throughput with low transaction costs, targeting a broad and global user base.

BNB Chain operates as a dual-chain architecture, which combines the capabilities of Binance Chain (BC) and Binance Smart Chain (BSC) into a single ecosystem. This design supports interoperability and flexible user experiences, allowing transfers and cross-chain communication between different blockchains.

**Efficient and Economical:**
BNB Chain provides a scalable infrastructure with significantly reduced transaction fees, making it accessible for a wide range of applications, from small transactions to large-scale dApps.

**EVM Compatibility:**
It fully supports Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible applications, enabling developers to migrate Ethereum-based dApps to BNB Chain with minimal adjustments and utilize the existing developer tools and ecosystem.

**Robust Community and Ecosystem:**
BNB Chain benefits from the strong community support and the extensive ecosystem of Binance, including integrations with Binanceâ€™s marketplaces, services, and large user base.
