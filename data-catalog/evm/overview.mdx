## Introduction to EVM Chains

The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) is the runtime environment for smart contracts in Ethereum. It's not only the cornerstone of Ethereum but also serves as a standard for decentralized applications across various blockchain networks. Due to its robustness and developer-friendly attributes, numerous blockchains have adopted the EVM framework, enabling them to leverage Ethereum's thriving ecosystem and interoperability.

### EVM Chains

We provide the most comprehensive data catalog for Ethereum Mainnet and EVM-compatible rollups, sidechains, and other layer 2 solutions. 
All EVM chains on Dune have raw data, decoded data, and curated data tables available. 

e.g. here are the available data sets for Ethereum Mainnet:
