## Table Description

The `logs` table represents the logs generated by the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) when a contract is executed on Berachain. As an EVM-identical chain, Berachain maintains complete compatibility with Ethereum's logging system while benefiting from its unique PoL consensus mechanism. Logs consist of:
- topic list: a list of 0 to 4 32-byte data topics
- data: contains non-indexed data
