## Table Description

The `traces` table contains the traces of transactions executed on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). It includes the traces of the transaction and the traces of internal transactions. Traces are the result of transaction execution and are used to debug and understand transaction execution. They are also known as `internal transactions` and can be used to understand the execution of a transaction.

This is the raw version of this table, for decoded transaction calls, see the [call tables](/data-catalog/evm/berachain/decoded/call-tables) section.
