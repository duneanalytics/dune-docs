## What is Superseed?

Superseed is a network that transforms Ethereum scaling into self-repaying loans. Built on the OP Stack, Superseed is an optimistic rollup that extends Ethereum's ability to enable financial freedom by maximizing capital efficiency and returning 100% of protocol revenue to users.

## Key Features

- **Zero Interest Yield**: Access yield at zero percent interest, with loans repaid effortlessly through protocol-generated fees
- **Proof-of-Repayment**: A unique programmatic reward mechanism where a small percentage of the native token's total supply is distributed daily through an auction, with proceeds used to repay Supercollateral users
- **Supercollateral**: Superseed's governance token plays a special role within the CDP protocol, allowing borrowers who meet safety requirements (e.g., a collateralization ratio of 500%) to secure loans without interest
- **Dynamic Repayment Vault**: Channels protocol fees into a smart contract that systematically burns debt, stabilizing the repayment rate for Supercollateral users
- **Native CDP Platform**: A Collateralized Debt Position platform enshrined in the rollup protocol
- **Superseed Stablecoin**: An overcollateralized stablecoin generated when users borrow against their assets, requiring collateral value to exceed 150% of the stablecoin's value

## Protocol Components

- **General-purpose Ethereum Layer 2**: Built on the OP Stack, open-source, permissionless, and Ethereum-equivalent
- **CDP Protocol**: Native collateralized debt position platform integrated into the rollup
- **Revenue Sources**: Sequencer profits, CDP interest, and inflationary rewards
- **Automatic Loan Repayment**: All fees generated across the network are used to burn the debt of Supercollateral users
