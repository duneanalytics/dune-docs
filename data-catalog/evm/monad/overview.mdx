## What is Monad?

Monad is a high-performance Ethereum-compatible L1 that materially advances the efficient frontier in the balance between decentralization and scalability. Monad introduces optimizations in five major areas, resulting in an Ethereum-compatible Layer-1 blockchain with 10,000 tps of throughput, 400ms block frequency, and 800ms finality.

## Key Features

- **MonadBFT**: Performant, tail-fork-resistant BFT consensus
- **RaptorCast**: Efficient block transmission
- **Asynchronous Execution**: Pipelining consensus and execution to raise the time budget for execution
- **Parallel Execution**: Efficient transaction execution
- **MonadDb**: Efficient state access
- **Full EVM Compatibility**: Complete bytecode equivalence for seamless application deployment
- **Ethereum RPC API Compatibility**: Familiar interface for users and developers

## Performance Characteristics

- **10,000 TPS**: High throughput for scalable applications
- **400ms Block Frequency**: Fast block production
- **800ms Finality**: Quick transaction finalization
- **Commodity Hardware**: Designed to run on standard hardware

## Architecture

Monad is designed with a focus on performance and scalability. The first Monad client is built by Category Labs and is written from scratch in C++ and Rust. The monad-bft consensus client implementation is open-source under GPL-3.0.

## Mainnet

Monad mainnet provides developers with a production-ready environment to deploy and run applications. The mainnet supports many leading Ethereum developer tools and infrastructure providers.
