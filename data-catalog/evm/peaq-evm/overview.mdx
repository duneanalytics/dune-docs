## What is Peaq?

Peaq EVM is the EVM chain of the layer-1 blockchain purpose-built PEAQ and optimized to power the Machine Economy. The platform enables decentralized physical infrastructure networks (DePINs), decentralized physical AI (DePAI), Machine DeFi, and Machine RWAs (Real-World Assets).

By leveraging parallelized block production, asynchronous backing, and agile core time, peaq currently handles up to 10,000 transactions per second (TPS). It is set to scale beyond 100,000 TPS after future upgrades, all while maintaining a minimum transaction cost of approximately $0.00025.

## Key Features and Advantages

### Machine Economy Focus

Peaq is purpose-built for the Machine Economy, supporting:
