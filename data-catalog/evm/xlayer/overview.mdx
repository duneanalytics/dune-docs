## What is X Layer?

X Layer is an Ethereum Layer 2 (L2) network, built by OKX on an enhanced Optimism Stack, designed to provide developers with a superior environment for scaling applications. It uses an optimistic rollup architecture where transactions are considered valid by default, with a 7-day challenge period for fraud proofs.

## Key Features and Advantages

### Full EVM Equivalence
- Deploy existing Ethereum applications without any code modifications
- Complete compatibility with standard Ethereum development tools
- Seamless migration from Ethereum mainnet

### Exceptional Performance
- Support for up to 5,000 transactions per second (TPS)
- Negligible gas fees for cost-effective transactions
- 1-second block times for fast execution
- Immediate transaction finality on L2 for most operations

### Battle-Tested Security
- Leverages robust optimistic rollup architecture
- Inherits security guarantees of Ethereum
- Cryptographic fraud proofs when needed
- All L2 data published to L1, ensuring trustless and censorship-resistant operation

### Enterprise-Grade Reliability
- Conductor high-availability cluster ensures sequencer redundancy
- 99.9% uptime for production-ready dApps
- Continuous synchronization between L2 and L1

### Network Specifications
- **Technology Stack**: Enhanced OP Stack
- **Gas Token**: OKB
- **Network Type**: EVM-compatible Layer 2
- **Base Chain**: Ethereum
- **Consensus**: Optimistic Rollup with 7-day challenge period

### Architecture Components
- **Virtual Machine**: EVM-equivalent
- **Sequencer**: Trusted (op-node in sequencer mode with op-geth via Engine API)
- **Bridge Service**: Monitors and syncs L1/L2 contract events
- **AggLayer Integration**: ZK proof generation for cross-chain settlement
