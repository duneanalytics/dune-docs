## What is TON?

The Open Network (TON) is a fast, secure, and scalable blockchain platform designed to handle millions of transactions per second. Originally developed by Telegram, TON features a unique architecture including:

- **Infinite Sharding**: Dynamic sharding mechanism that allows the network to automatically split and merge blockchains to adapt to load.
- **Proof-of-Stake**: Secure and energy-efficient consensus mechanism.
- **TON Virtual Machine (TVM)**: Handles smart contract execution with support for multiple programming languages.
- **Jettons**: TON's implementation of fungible tokens (similar to ERC-20).
