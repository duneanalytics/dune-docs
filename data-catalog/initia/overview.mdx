## What is Initia?

Initia's core philosophy is to make opinionated decisions on the underlying infrastructure such as data availability, interoperability, and oracles. By reducing decision fatigue, the Interwoven Stack empowers developers with the tools to craft application-specific environments while maintaining un-fragmented accessibility to the application ecosystem.

Initia provides a framework that powers all of Initia's rollups through the Interwoven Stack, featuring enshrined liquidity solutions for bootstrapping cross-chain liquidity while maintaining network security. The platform includes InitiaDEX, Minitswap, and a Vested Interest Program (VIP) that aims to foster long-term ecosystem-wide alignment.
