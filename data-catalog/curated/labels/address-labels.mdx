The `labels.addresses` table on Dune catalogs specific blockchain addresses, associating them with descriptive labels, categories, and usage metrics. This table is a superset of many other `labels.<category>` tables, providing a comprehensive overview of labeled addresses across various categories and blockchains.
You can use the `category` column to filter labels for the specific type of address you are interested in.
