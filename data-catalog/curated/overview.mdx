## Overview

Dune and its community are building a collection of curated data tables that make it easier to query and analyze blockchain data. These tables are built using dbt, a tool that allows you to transform data in your warehouse using SQL and Jinja templating. We sometimes refer to these tables as _curated tables_ and the collection of them as _Curated Data Sets_.

The curated data tables are built on top of raw data tables and provide a high-level view of the data across multiple blockchain networks. For example, the `dex.trades` table aggregates data from multiple sources to provide a comprehensive view of all trades on decentralized exchanges across EVM networks, while `dex_solana.trades` provides similar coverage for Solana DEXs.

The curated data tables are maintained in the [Spellbook repository](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook) and are available for anyone to use.

## Benefits of Curated Data Tables

Curated data tables provide several benefits:

- **Simplified Queries**: Curated data tables make it easier to query and analyze blockchain data by providing a high-level view of the data.
- **Cross-Chain Analysis**: Consistent data models enable easy comparison between different blockchain networks.
- **Consistent Data Models**: The curated data tables follow consistent data models, making it easier to combine data from different sources.
- **Community Contributions**: The curated data tables are maintained by the Dune community, so anyone can contribute to them and improve the data quality.
