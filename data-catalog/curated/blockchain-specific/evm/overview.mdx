## Overview

This page provides EVM-specific information about Dune's curated data tables. For the main curated data categories, please see:

- [DEX Trades Data](/data-catalog/curated/dex-trades/overview) - DEX trades across EVM and Solana
- [NFT Trades Data](/data-catalog/curated/nft-trades/overview) - NFT activity across all networks  
- [Token Transfer Data](/data-catalog/curated/token-transfers/overview) - Token transfers and balances across chains

## EVM-Specific Features

EVM curated data tables provide specific features for EVM-compatible networks:

- **Standardized across 40+ EVM chains**: Consistent schema from Ethereum to Layer 2s
- **Smart contract integration**: Decoded events and function calls
- **MEV detection**: Sandwich attacks and other MEV activities
- **Gas and fee tracking**: Comprehensive transaction cost analysis

## EVM Network Coverage

Our EVM curated data covers:

- **Ethereum Mainnet**: The original EVM network
- **Layer 2 Solutions**: Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, Base, and more
- **Alternative EVM chains**: Avalanche, Fantom, BNB Chain, and others
- **Testnets**: Sepolia and other test networks

## Example Query

Here's a simple query to analyze EVM DEX trading activity across multiple chains:

```sql
SELECT 
    blockchain,
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as date,
    COUNT(*) as num_trades,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM dex.trades
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1
```

import { QueryContainer } from "/snippets/query-container.mdx";

<QueryContainer queryText="SELECT blockchain, date_trunc('day', block_time) as date, COUNT(*) as num_trades, SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd FROM dex.trades WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day GROUP BY 1, 2 ORDER BY 2 DESC, 1" />

## Coverage and Limitations

The EVM curated tables aim to provide comprehensive coverage of on-chain activity, but there are some limitations to be aware of:

- Token transfers are captured through standard ERC20/721/1155 events
- Some non-standard token implementations may not be fully captured
- DEX coverage includes major protocols but may not capture all DEX activity
- Data is typically available with a short delay after on-chain finality
- Coverage may vary by chain and protocol

For the most up-to-date coverage information, please check the documentation for each specific table.
