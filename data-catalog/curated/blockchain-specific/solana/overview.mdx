## Overview

This page provides Solana-specific information about Dune's curated data tables. For the main curated data categories, please see:

- [DEX Trades Data](/data-catalog/curated/dex-trades/overview) - DEX trades across EVM and Solana
- [NFT Trades Data](/data-catalog/curated/nft-trades/overview) - NFT activity across all networks  
- [Token Transfer Data](/data-catalog/curated/token-transfers/overview) - Token transfers and balances across chains

## Solana-Specific Features

Solana curated data tables provide specific features for the Solana blockchain:

- **SPL Token support**: Comprehensive coverage of SPL tokens and Token22 program
- **Program-based architecture**: Data structured around Solana's program model
- **High-performance tracking**: Optimized for Solana's high-throughput environment
- **Account-based model**: Detailed account state and balance tracking

## Solana Program Coverage

Our Solana curated data covers major programs:

- **Token Programs**: SPL Token, Token22 (Token Extensions)
- **DEX Programs**: Orca, Raydium, Serum, and other major DEXs
- **NFT Programs**: Metaplex and other NFT standards
- **Aggregators**: Jupiter and other routing protocols

## Example Query

Here's a simple query to analyze Solana token transfer activity:

```sql
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as date,
    COUNT(*) as num_transfers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT from_address) as unique_senders
FROM solana.token_transfers
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

## Coverage and Limitations

The Solana curated tables aim to provide comprehensive coverage of on-chain activity, but there are some limitations to be aware of:

- Token and NFT transfers are captured through standard SPL token program events
- Some non-standard token implementations may not be fully captured
- DEX coverage includes major protocols but may not capture all DEX activity
- Data is typically available with a short delay after on-chain finality

For the most up-to-date coverage information, please check the documentation for each specific table.
