Blockchain networks have become popular platforms for creating, managing, and trading digital assets. These assets are often represented as tokens, which can be transferred between addresses and owned by users. Dune provides comprehensive token transfer tracking capabilities across multiple blockchain networks through curated tables that simplify the process of monitoring and analyzing token transfers across both EVM and Solana ecosystems.

## Cross-Chain Token Transfer Coverage

Our token transfer data covers multiple blockchain ecosystems:

- **EVM Networks**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, Optimism, and 40+ other EVM chains
- **Solana**: Comprehensive coverage of SPL tokens and native SOL transfers

## Available Datasets

### EVM Token Transfers

  <Card title="Token Transfers" icon="arrow-right" href="/data-catalog/curated/token-transfers/evm/token-transfers">
    Transfer events for ERC20 tokens and native currencies on EVM networks
  </Card>

  <Card title="NFT Transfers" icon="arrow-left" href="/data-catalog/curated/nft-trades/evm/nft-transfers">
    Transfer events for ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens on EVM networks
  </Card>

## Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Coverage**: Track token transfers across EVM and Solana ecosystems
- **Standardized Schema**: Consistent data structure for cross-chain analysis
- **Transfer Analytics**: Detailed transfer events with sender, receiver, and amounts
- **Real-time Updates**: Data is updated continuously as new blocks are processed

## Sample Cross-Chain Analysis

Compare token transfer activity across different blockchain networks:

```sql
-- EVM token transfers
SELECT 
    'EVM' as ecosystem,
    blockchain,
    DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) as date,
    COUNT(*) as num_transfers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT from_address) as unique_senders
FROM tokens.transfers
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3

UNION ALL

-- Solana token transfers
SELECT 
    'Solana' as ecosystem,
    'solana' as blockchain,
    DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) as date,
    COUNT(*) as num_transfers,
    COUNT(DISTINCT from_address) as unique_senders
FROM solana.token_transfers
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3

ORDER BY date DESC, num_transfers DESC
```

These datasets enable users to perform a wide range of analyses across multiple blockchain networks, providing valuable insights into the dynamics of digital assets across various blockchain ecosystems.
