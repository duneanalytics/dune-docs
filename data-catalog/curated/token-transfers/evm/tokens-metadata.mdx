The `tokens.erc20` table contains metadata for ERC20 tokens across all EVM-compatible networks indexed on Dune. This dataset provides essential information about ERC20 tokens, including:

- The blockchain on which the token exists
- The contract address of the token
- The token symbol
- The token name
- The number of decimals used by the token

### Coverage

This table covers tokens across all EVM chains on Dune. Tokens are automatically detected and included when they meet the following criteria:
- Have emitted ERC20 Transfer events
- Have at least 1 transfer recorded on-chain

New tokens meeting these criteria are added to the table within approximately 1 hour of detection.

### Data Sources

We use [Sim API](https://docs.sim.dune.com/evm/token-info) to retrieve token metadata for all qualifying contracts. For chains not supported on Sim API, we fall back to [DefinedFi](https://docs.defined.fi/reference/token) as our metadata provider.

Native tokens are also included in this dataset, using metadata information from `dune.blockchains`.

### Utility

The ERC20 metadata table offers valuable information for token analysis and integration, allowing you to:

- Identify tokens across different blockchains
- Retrieve essential token information for calculations and display

The table contains the following columns:

import { ColumnDescriptions } from "/snippets/column-descriptions.mdx";

<ColumnDescriptions tableSchema="tokens" tableName="erc20" />

import { TableSample } from "/snippets/table-sample.mdx";

<TableSample tableSchema="tokens" tableName="erc20" />

## Sample Queries

**Query ERC20 tokens on a specific blockchain**

This query returns ERC20 tokens on the Ethereum blockchain:

```sql
SELECT
    contract_address,
    symbol,
    decimals
FROM tokens.erc20
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
LIMIT 100
```

**Find tokens with a specific symbol across blockchains**

This query finds all tokens with the symbol "USDC" across different blockchains:

```sql
SELECT
    blockchain,
    contract_address,
    symbol,
    decimals
FROM tokens.erc20
WHERE symbol = 'USDC'
```

**List tokens with non-standard decimal places**

This query lists tokens that don't use the standard 18 decimal places:

```sql
SELECT
    blockchain,
    contract_address,
    symbol,
    decimals
FROM tokens.erc20
WHERE decimals != 18
ORDER BY decimals DESC
LIMIT 50
```

**Count tokens by blockchain**

This query shows the distribution of tokens across different blockchains:

```sql
SELECT
    blockchain,
    COUNT(*) as token_count
FROM tokens.erc20
GROUP BY blockchain
ORDER BY token_count DESC
```
