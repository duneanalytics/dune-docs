# prices.minute

## Overview

The `prices.minute` table provides minute-level price data for tokens across multiple blockchains using the same **hybrid approach** as all other price tables:

1. **Coinpaprika prices** for tokens where we have reliable external data (~2,000 major tokens)
2. **DEX-derived prices** for the long tail of tokens not covered by coinpaprika

Minute-level data uses interpolation from hourly anchor points to provide smooth, continuous pricing.

<Info>
    Minute-level data uses interpolation between hourly anchor points for smooth pricing. Forward-filling is applied for up to 48 hours when no trading activity exists.

## Table Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| blockchain | varchar | Blockchain identifier (e.g., 'ethereum', 'arbitrum') |
| contract_address | varbinary | Token contract address (fixed address for native tokens) |
| symbol | varchar | Token symbol (e.g., 'ETH', 'USDC') |
| timestamp | timestamp | Minute timestamp |
| price | double | Token price in USD (volume-weighted average) |
| decimals | int | Token decimals |
| volume | double | Trading volume in USD (from price source) |
| source | varchar | Data source ('coinpaprika' or 'dex.trades') |

## Implementation Details

The minute prices are built using the hybrid approach with interpolation:

1. **Source prioritization**: Coinpaprika prices for ~2,000 major tokens, DEX-derived prices for long tail tokens
2. **Hourly interpolation**: Uses hourly data as anchor points for linear interpolation
3. **Linear interpolation**: Implements interpolation between hourly anchor points to create smooth minute-level data
4. **Noise reduction**: Reduces noise and outliers by using stable hourly data points as anchors
5. **Forward-filling**: The system forward-fills with the last available price for a maximum of 48 hours (2880 minutes) to avoid stale data
6. **Continuous time series**: Provides minute-by-minute data points for every minute between hourly anchors

### Source-Specific Variants

#### `prices_coinpaprika.minute`
For purely coinpaprika-based minute prices:
- **Coverage**: Only tokens with Coinpaprika listings (~2,000 tokens)
- **Source**: External exchange-aggregated minute pricing with interpolation
- **Use case**: When you need minute-level external price validation
- **Key role**: Serves as the underlying source for the `prices.usd` legacy view
- **Schema**: Same as `prices.minute` but `source` is always 'coinpaprika'

#### `prices_dex.minute`
For purely DEX-derived minute prices:
- **Coverage**: All tokens with sufficient DEX trading volume
- **Source**: On-chain DEX trading activity with interpolation
- **Use case**: When you need minute-level pricing that reflects on-chain activity
- **Schema**: Same as `prices.minute` but `source` is always 'dex.trades'

## Usage

This table is ideal for high-frequency analysis and examining short-term price movements. It's particularly useful for studying price impacts of specific events or transactions with high temporal precision.

**Important Notes**: 
- The minute-level data is interpolated from hourly anchor points using the hybrid approach
- Provides comprehensive token coverage through coinpaprika and DEX-derived sources
- Provides smooth and consistent pricing while reducing the impact of noise and outliers

## Latency and Update Frequency

The `prices.minute` table is updated hourly based on the upstream data pipeline. As a result, prices typically have a latency of approximately 1 hour from real-time.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the prices tables.

### Get minute-by-minute ETH prices during a specific event:
```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  price
FROM prices.minute
WHERE
  blockchain = 'ethereum'
  AND contract_address = 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 -- WETH
  AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '2' HOUR
  AND timestamp <= NOW() - INTERVAL '1' HOUR
ORDER BY timestamp
```

### Analyze price volatility within short time frames:
```sql
SELECT
  date_trunc('hour', timestamp) as hour,
  max(price) - min(price) as price_range,
  (max(price) - min(price)) / min(price) * 100 as volatility_pct
FROM prices.minute
WHERE
  blockchain = 'ethereum'
  AND contract_address = 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 -- WETH
  AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1' DAY
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

## Data Quality Notes

- Due to its high granularity, queries on this table may be more resource-intensive
- Consider using `prices.hour` or `prices.day` for longer time ranges if minute-level precision is not required
- **Comprehensive coverage**: Includes both coinpaprika and DEX-derived tokens through hybrid approach
- Native tokens (like ETH, BNB) are assigned fixed addresses for consistency
- Always use `contract_address` and `blockchain` for precise token identification, never use `symbol` for joins or filters
- **Interpolated Pricing**: Minute-level data is interpolated from hourly anchor points using hybrid methodology
- **Reduced Noise**: The interpolation approach reduces the impact of noise and outliers
- **48-Hour Forward-Fill**: The system forward-fills with the last available price for a maximum of 48 hours (2880 minutes) to avoid stale data
- **External source reliability**: Coinpaprika data provides stable, exchange-aggregated pricing
- **DEX-derived limitations**: DEX-derived prices can contain errors due to low liquidity, market manipulation, or anomalous trades
- **Fallback option**: For critical applications, consider using `prices_coinpaprika.minute` for more reliable pricing where available
- **Data validation**: Always validate prices for critical applications, especially for lesser-known tokens
