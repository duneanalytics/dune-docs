# prices.hour

## Overview

The `prices.hour` table provides hourly token price data across all supported blockchains. It contains volume-weighted average prices for each hour, ensuring a continuous time series for more granular price analysis than daily data.

## Table Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| blockchain | varchar | Blockchain identifier (e.g., 'ethereum', 'arbitrum') |
| contract_address | varbinary | Token contract address (fixed address for native tokens) |
| symbol | varchar | Token symbol (e.g., 'ETH', 'USDC') |
| timestamp | timestamp | Hour timestamp (00:00, 01:00, etc. UTC of each hour) |
| price | double | Token price in USD (volume-weighted average) |
| decimals | int | Token decimals |
| volume | double | Trading volume in USD (from price source) |
| source | varchar | Data source ('coinpaprika' or 'dex.trades') |

## Implementation Details

The hourly prices are built through these steps:

1. Collect sparse price observations from different sources
2. Group by hour, calculating volume-weighted average price per hour
3. Fill missing hours with the previous hour's price (forward filling)
4. Set a 7-day (168 hour) expiration for forward filling to avoid stale data

## Usage

This table is useful for intraday analysis and tracking price movements with higher granularity than daily data. It's suitable for examining price patterns within a day or across multiple days.

## Latency and Update Frequency

The `prices.hour` table is updated hourly based on the upstream data pipeline. As a result, prices typically have a latency of approximately 1 hour from real-time.

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the prices tables.

### Get hourly ETH prices for the last day:
```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  price
FROM prices.hour
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
AND contract_address = 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 -- WETH
AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1' DAY
ORDER BY timestamp
```

### Calculate volatility by hour of day:
```sql
SELECT
  extract(hour from timestamp) as hour_of_day,
  avg(abs(price - lag(price) OVER (PARTITION BY blockchain, contract_address ORDER BY timestamp))
      / lag(price) OVER (PARTITION BY blockchain, contract_address ORDER BY timestamp)) as avg_hourly_change
FROM prices.hour
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
AND contract_address = 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 -- WETH
AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' DAY
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1
```

## Data Quality Notes

- Prices older than 7 days (168 hours) will not be forward-filled to avoid using stale data
- Native tokens (like ETH, BNB) are assigned fixed addresses for consistency
- Hourly data is useful for analyzing intraday patterns and short-term price movements
- Always use `contract_address` and `blockchain` for precise token identification, never use `symbol` for joins or filters
- Prices are calculated using volume-weighted averages for more accurate representation
- **Quality Filtering**: The system includes filtering mechanisms to reduce the impact of anomalous trades
- **Data Limitations**: While filtering helps improve data quality, users should always validate prices for critical applications
