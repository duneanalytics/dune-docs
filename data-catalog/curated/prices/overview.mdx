# Prices (Token Price Data)

Dune provides reliable token price data for use in your queries across 40+ blockchains. This implementation is a complete rewrite of the price aggregation system with significant improvements.

## Key Features

- **Multi-blockchain support**: Prices for tokens across 40+ blockchains
- **Standardized native token addresses**: Native tokens (like ETH, BNB) have fixed contract addresses for consistency
- **Multiple time granularities**: hourly, daily, and latest price data
- **Source transparency**: Each price point includes its data source
- **Data quality**: Comprehensive filters to ensure price reliability

## Available Tables

The `prices` schema exposes these main tables:

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `prices.latest` | The most recent price for each token |
| `prices.day` | Daily token prices (most recent price of each day) |
| `prices.hour` | Hourly token prices |
| `prices.minute` | Minute-by-minute token prices |

For best performance, use the table with the coarsest granularity that meets your analytical needs. Querying minute-level data over long time periods can be very resource-intensive.

## Implementation Details

The price system works in multiple layers:

1. **Base data sources**:
   - External price feeds (Coinpaprika)
   - DEX trading data (from `dex.trades`)

2. **Data processing pipeline**:
   - Sparse minute data collected from both sources
   - Aggregated to hourly and daily sparse records
   - Filled into continuous time series for steady time intervals

3. **Token handling**:
   - Native tokens are assigned fixed addresses instead of NULL or 0xeeee...
   - You can find the correct native token address for each blockchain in the `dune.blockchains` table
   - Trusted tokens (major stablecoins, wrapped assets) serve as price anchors
   - Non-trusted tokens derive prices through DEX trades against trusted tokens
   - Simply put: We use prices from trusted tokens to calculate prices of other tokens based on the data from DEX trades

## Coverage

- 900,000 unique tokens
- 40+ blockchains
- new tokens are automatically added when they exceed a $10k volume threshold

## Schema

All price tables share the following schema (with slight variations):

| Column             | Type        | Description                                                                      |
| ------------------ | ----------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `blockchain`       | _varchar_   | Blockchain identifier (e.g., 'ethereum', 'arbitrum')                             |
| `contract_address` | _varbinary_ | Token contract address (fixed address for native tokens)                         |
| `symbol`           | _varchar_   | Token symbol (e.g., 'ETH', 'USDC')                                               |
| `price`            | _double_    | USD price                                                                        |
| `timestamp`        | _timestamp_ | Timestamp (start of minute, hour, or day)                                        |
| `decimals`         | _int_       | Token decimals                                                                   |
| `volume`           | _double_    | Trading volume in USD (from price source)                                        |
| `source`           | _varchar_   | Data source ('coinpaprika' or 'dex.trades')                                      |
| `source_timestamp` | _timestamp_ | Exact timestamp of the source data point                                         |

## Technical Notes

- Prices are calculated independently per blockchain
- Token identification requires both `contract_address` AND `blockchain`
- `symbol` is not unique - do not use for token identification or joins
- For native tokens, use the standardized addresses from `dune.blockchains` table
- If there are no trades for a token, we use the last available price and carry it forward for a limited time period:
  - 30 days for daily prices
  - 7 days for hourly prices
  - 2 days for minute prices



## Methodology

### Step 1: Importing Trusted Token Prices

Dune sources trusted token prices from [Coin Paprika](https://coinpaprika.com/). These prices:

- Cover major tokens that are defined in the `prices.trusted_tokens` table
- Serve as base prices for calculating prices of other tokens traded against them in DEX pairs

### Step 2: DEX-Derived Prices

For details on how Dune processes DEX trade data to derive accurate token prices, see the [DEX Trade Processing](/data-catalog/curated/evm/DEX/dex-trades):

- We start by collecting raw trading data from the `dex.trades` table
- We calculate prices for trading pairs where one token is from our trusted token list
- The data then goes through our processing pipeline which:
  - Excludes trades with less than $10,000 USD in total volume
  - Takes the median price from each minute to reduce outlier impact
  - Calculates USD prices using our trusted token prices as reference
  - Uses forward-filling to handle periods without valid trades, with time limits
   - 30 days for daily prices
   - 7 days for hourly prices
   - 2 days for minute prices 

## Usage Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the prices tables.
 
### Basic query to get the latest ETH price:
```sql
SELECT price
FROM prices.latest
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum' 
AND contract_address = 0xc02aaa39b223fe8d0a0e5c4f27ead9083c756cc2 -- WETH
```

### Getting historical price data:
```sql
SELECT
  timestamp,
  price
FROM prices.day
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
AND contract_address = 0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984 -- UNI
AND timestamp >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' DAY
```

### Finding the right native token address:
```sql
-- Query to get the native token address for a specific blockchain
SELECT 
  name,
  token_address,
  token_symbol
FROM dune.blockchains
WHERE name = 'arbitrum'
```

## Legacy Tables

The following tables are maintained for historical compatibility but we no longer add tokens to them:

- `prices.usd`
- `prices.usd_daily`
- `prices.usd_latest`
