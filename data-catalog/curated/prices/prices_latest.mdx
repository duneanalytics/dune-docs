# prices.latest

## Overview

The `prices.latest` table provides the most recently available price for each token across all supported blockchains. This table is ideal for calculating current token values or displaying up-to-date prices.

## Table Schema

| Column | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| blockchain | varchar | Blockchain identifier (e.g., 'ethereum', 'arbitrum') |
| contract_address | varbinary | Token contract address (fixed address for native tokens) |
| symbol | varchar | Token symbol (e.g., 'ETH', 'USDC') |
| price | double | Most recent token price in USD |
| decimals | int | Token decimals |
| timestamp | timestamp | Timestamp when this price was recorded |
| volume | double | Trading volume in USD (from price source) |
| source | varchar | Data source ('coinpaprika' or 'dex.trades') |
| source_timestamp | timestamp | Exact timestamp of the source data point |

## Implementation Details

The latest prices are built by:

1. Taking the most recent price observation from each data source
2. Selecting the latest observation per token across all sources
3. Refreshed hourly to ensure prices stay current

## Usage

This table is perfect for querying the current price of tokens without needing to filter by timestamp or perform additional aggregations. It's designed for efficiency when you just need the most recent price.

## Usage Examples

Get current prices for major tokens:
```sql
SELECT
  blockchain,
  symbol,
  price,
  timestamp
FROM prices.latest
WHERE (blockchain, symbol) IN (
  ('ethereum', 'ETH'),
  ('ethereum', 'USDC'),
  ('ethereum', 'WBTC'),
  ('arbitrum', 'ETH'),
  ('optimism', 'ETH')
)
```

Calculate total USD value of token holdings:
```sql
WITH token_balances AS (
  SELECT
    token_address,
    sum(amount) as total_tokens
  FROM my_token_balance_table
  GROUP BY 1
)

SELECT
  b.token_address,
  p.symbol,
  b.total_tokens,
  b.total_tokens * p.price as usd_value
FROM token_balances b
JOIN prices.latest p
  ON p.blockchain = 'ethereum'
  AND p.contract_address = b.token_address
```

## Data Quality Notes

- Native tokens (like ETH, BNB) are assigned fixed addresses for consistency
- The timestamp column shows when the price was last updated, useful for determining freshness
- For historical analysis, use `prices.day`, `prices.hour`, or `prices.minute` instead
- Always use `contract_address` and `blockchain` for precise token identification, `symbol` is not unique
