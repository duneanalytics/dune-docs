The trading tables provide essential data for analyzing Solana's DEX ecosystem:

- Compare performance between different DEXs and aggregators
- Identify trading patterns and trends

## Sample Query

Here's a simple query to get started analyzing DEX trading volume:

```sql
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) as date,
    project,
    COUNT(*) as num_trades,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM dex_solana.trades
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 1 DESC, 4 DESC
```

These datasets provide valuable insights into trading activity across the Solana ecosystem, enabling users to understand market dynamics and analyze trading patterns on the network.
