description: Curated DEX trading data across multiple blockchain networks
---

Decentralized exchanges (DEXs) have become a cornerstone of DeFi, enabling permissionless trading of tokens directly on-chain. Dune provides comprehensive coverage of DEX activity through curated tables that capture trades, aggregator usage, and MEV events like sandwich attacks across both EVM and Solana networks. These datasets enable analysis of trading volumes, liquidity dynamics, price impact, and market manipulation across major DEX protocols and networks.

## Cross-Chain DEX Coverage

Our DEX data covers multiple blockchain ecosystems:

- **EVM Networks**: Ethereum, Arbitrum, Polygon, Base, Optimism, and 40+ other EVM chains
- **Solana**: Comprehensive coverage of Solana DEX protocols and Jupiter aggregator

## Key Features

- **Multi-Chain Coverage**: Analyze DEX activity across EVM and Solana ecosystems
- **Standardized Schema**: Consistent data structure for cross-chain analysis
- **MEV Detection**: Identify sandwich attacks and other MEV activities (EVM)
- **Aggregator Data**: Track trades through major aggregators on both networks
- **Real-time Updates**: Data is updated continuously as new blocks are processed

## Sample Cross-Chain Analysis

Compare DEX trading volume across different blockchain networks:

```sql
-- EVM DEX volume
SELECT 
    'EVM' as ecosystem,
    blockchain,
    DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) as date,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM dex.trades
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3

UNION ALL

-- Solana DEX volume  
SELECT 
    'Solana' as ecosystem,
    'solana' as blockchain,
    DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) as date,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM dex_solana.trades
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3

ORDER BY date DESC, volume_usd DESC
```
