## Table Description

The `dex.sandwiched` table captures detailed data on the victim trades of sandwich attacks executed via decentralized exchanges (DEXs). This table records the transactions that have been sandwiched between front-running and back-running trades. It provides a comprehensive view of sandwich attack victims across various EVM networks.

## Functional Overview

The `dex.sandwiched` table provides an in-depth view of the victim trades in sandwich attacks on decentralized exchanges. A sandwich attack occurs when a trader (usually a bot) spots a pending transaction in the mempool, quickly executes a trade before it (front-running), and then immediately after it (back-running) to profit from the price movement caused by the victim's trade.

This table includes entries for:
1. The victim trade that has been sandwiched

Note that the front-running and back-running trades that sandwich these victim trades are captured in a separate table, `dex.sandwiches`.

This detailed approach allows for granular analysis of sandwich attack patterns, enabling users to:

- **Identify Sandwich Attack Victims**: Easily spot instances of trades that have been sandwiched across different DEXs and networks.
- **Analyze Attack Impacts**: Understand the frequency, size, and potential losses of sandwiched trades.
- **Monitor Market Vulnerability**: Gain insights into which trades are most susceptible to sandwich attacks across different DEXs and EVM networks.

By providing comprehensive details of the victim trades in sandwich attacks, the `dex.sandwiched` table supports advanced analytics and research into DEX trading behavior, market manipulation, and potential areas for improved trade execution or protocol design to protect users from sandwich attacks.
