## Sample Queries

**Query recent token transfers for a specific address**

This query returns the most recent token transfers (both incoming and outgoing) for a specified address:

```sql
SELECT
    block_time,
    action,
    CASE 
        WHEN from_owner = '7F9KJm6rcW2PAgUkRmqXhzMmUpxWcQcLFjarE4bwniqZ' THEN 'Outgoing'
        WHEN to_owner = '7F9KJm6rcW2PAgUkRmqXhzMmUpxWcQcLFjarE4bwniqZ' THEN 'Incoming'
    END AS direction,
    amount,
    token_mint_address
FROM tokens_solana.transfers
WHERE (from_owner = '7F9KJm6rcW2PAgUkRmqXhzMmUpxWcQcLFjarE4bwniqZ' OR to_owner = '7F9KJm6rcW2PAgUkRmqXhzMmUpxWcQcLFjarE4bwniqZ')
    AND block_time > now() - interval '30' day
ORDER BY block_time DESC
LIMIT 100
```
