The `tokens.transfers` table contains token transfer events across ERC20 tokens and native tokens for all EVM-compatible networks indexed on Dune. This dataset encompasses:

- Transfer events for ERC20 tokens
- WETH deposits and withdrawals
- Native currency transfers
  - Transaction value transfers
  - Trace value transfers
  - Gas used transfers

<Info>
 Some erc20 tokens and native currencies have non-standard ways of being transferred and might not be included in the transfers table.
 You can check the logic for the transfers table [here](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/dbt_subprojects/tokens/models/transfers_and_balances). The level of detail of the transfers table will vary by chain.

### Utility

The transfers table provides a comprehensive view of token movement across networks, enabling you to:

- Track token flows between addresses
- Analyze transaction volumes and patterns
- Identify significant token movements
- Monitor exchange and DeFi protocol activity


The table contains the following columns:

import { ColumnDescriptions } from "/snippets/column-descriptions.mdx";

<ColumnDescriptions tableSchema="tokens" tableName="transfers" />

import { TableSample } from "/snippets/table-sample.mdx";

<TableSample tableSchema="tokens" tableName="transfers" />

### Network Coverage

Transfer data is available for the following EVM-compatible networks:

## Sample Queries

**Query recent token transfers for a specific address**

This query returns the most recent token transfers (both incoming and outgoing) for a specified address:

```sql
SELECT
    block_time,
    symbol,
    CASE 
        WHEN "from" = 0x5DD596C901987A2b28C38A9C1DfBf86fFFc15d77 THEN 'Outgoing'
        WHEN "to" = 0x5DD596C901987A2b28C38A9C1DfBf86fFFc15d77 THEN 'Incoming'
    END AS direction,
    amount,
    amount_usd
FROM tokens.transfers
WHERE ("from" = 0x5DD596C901987A2b28C38A9C1DfBf86fFFc15d77 OR "to" = 0x5DD596C901987A2b28C38A9C1DfBf86fFFc15d77)
    AND block_time > now() - interval '30' day
ORDER BY block_time DESC
LIMIT 100
```

**Calculate daily transfer volume for a specific token**

This query calculates the daily transfer volume for a specific ERC20 token. 

Please be aware that token volumes are not necessarily indicative of anything. These metric can be misleading if the token is not well-known or if there are a lot of small transfers. Token transfers can be mints, burns, transfers, flashloans and anything in between, trying to read into the data can lead to misleading results.

```sql
SELECT
    block_date,
    COUNT(*) AS num_transfers,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount,
    SUM(amount_usd) AS total_amount_usd
FROM tokens.transfers
WHERE contract_address = 0x1f9840a85d5af5bf1d1762f925bdaddc4201f984
    AND block_time > now() - interval '30' day
    and blockchain = 'ethereum'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

**Identify largest transfers in the last 24 hours**

This query finds the largest token transfers by USD value in the last 24 hours:

```sql
SELECT
    block_time,
    token_symbol,
    "from",
    "to",
    amount,
    amount_usd
FROM tokens.transfers
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '1' day
    AND amount_usd IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY amount_usd DESC
LIMIT 50
```
