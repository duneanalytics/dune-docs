Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) have emerged as a major force in the crypto ecosystem, enabling unique digital assets and collectibles. Dune provides comprehensive coverage of NFT market activity through curated tables that capture trades, mints, transfers, and metadata across both EVM and Solana networks. These datasets enable analysis of sales volumes, collection trends, minting patterns, and market dynamics across major NFT marketplaces and networks.

## Cross-Chain NFT Coverage

Our NFT data covers multiple blockchain ecosystems:

- **EVM Networks**: Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Base, Optimism, and 40+ other EVM chains
- **Solana**: Comprehensive coverage of Solana NFT ecosystem and metadata

## Sample Cross-Chain Analysis

Compare NFT trading activity across different blockchain networks:

```sql
-- EVM NFT trades
SELECT 
    'EVM' as ecosystem,
    blockchain,
    DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) as date,
    COUNT(*) as num_trades,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume_usd
FROM nft.trades
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3

UNION ALL

-- Solana NFT transfers (as proxy for activity)
SELECT 
    'Solana' as ecosystem,
    'solana' as blockchain,
    DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) as date,
    COUNT(*) as num_transfers,
    NULL as volume_usd
FROM solana.nft_transfers
WHERE block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' day
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3

ORDER BY date DESC, volume_usd DESC NULLS LAST
```
