The `tokens_solana.nft` table contains NFT transfer events for tokens on the Solana blockchain indexed on Dune. This dataset encompasses transfer events for various Solana NFT standards.

<Info>
 Some Solana NFTs may have non-standard transfer mechanisms and might not be included in the transfers table.
 You can check the logic for the transfers table [here](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/blob/main/dbt_subprojects/solana/models/tokens/solana/tokens_solana_nft.sql).
