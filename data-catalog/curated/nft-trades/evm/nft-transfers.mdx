import { DuneEmbed } from "/snippets/dune-embed.mdx";

The `nft.transfers` table contains NFT transfer events across ERC721 and ERC1155 tokens for all EVM-compatible networks indexed on Dune. This dataset encompasses:

- Transfer events for ERC721 tokens
- Transfer events for ERC1155 tokens

<Info>
 Some NFTs may have non-standard transfer mechanisms and might not be included in the transfers table.
 You can check the logic for the transfers table [here](https://github.com/duneanalytics/spellbook/tree/main/dbt_subprojects/nft/models/_sector/transfers). The level of detail of the transfers table will vary by chain.

### Utility

The NFT transfers table provides a comprehensive view of NFT movement across networks, enabling you to:

- Track NFT flows between addresses
- Analyze NFT transaction volumes and patterns
- Identify significant NFT movements
- Monitor NFT marketplace and protocol activity

The table contains the following columns:

import { ColumnDescriptions } from "/snippets/column-descriptions.mdx";

<ColumnDescriptions tableSchema="nft" tableName="transfers" />

import { TableSample } from "/snippets/table-sample.mdx";

<TableSample tableSchema="nft" tableName="transfers" />

### Network Coverage

NFT transfer data is available for the following EVM-compatible networks:

## Sample Queries

**Query recent NFT transfers for a specific address**

This query returns the most recent NFT transfers (both incoming and outgoing) for a specified address:

```sql
SELECT
    block_time,
    token_standard,
    CASE 
        WHEN "from" = {{address}} THEN 'Outgoing'
        WHEN "to" = {{address}} THEN 'Incoming'
    END AS direction,
    contract_address,
    token_id,
    amount
FROM nft.transfers
WHERE ("from" = {{address}} OR "to" = {{address}})
    AND block_time > now() - interval '30' day
ORDER BY block_time DESC
LIMIT 100
```

**Calculate daily transfer volume for a specific NFT contract**

This query calculates the daily transfer volume for a specific NFT contract:

```sql
SELECT
    block_date,
    COUNT(*) AS num_transfers,
    SUM(amount) AS total_amount
FROM nft.transfers
WHERE contract_address = {{contract_address}}
    AND block_time > now() - interval '30' day
    AND blockchain = 'ethereum'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```

**Identify most active NFT contracts in the last 24 hours**

This query finds the most active NFT contracts by transfer count in the last 24 hours:

```sql
SELECT
    blockchain,
    contract_address,
    token_standard,
    COUNT(*) AS transfer_count
FROM nft.transfers
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '1' day
GROUP BY 1, 2, 3
ORDER BY transfer_count DESC
LIMIT 50
```
