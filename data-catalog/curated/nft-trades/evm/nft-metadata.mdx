The `tokens.nft` table contains metadata for NFTs across all EVM-compatible networks indexed on Dune. This dataset provides essential information about NFTs, including:

- The blockchain on which the NFT exists
- The contract address of the NFT
- The name of the NFT collection
- The symbol of the NFT collection
- The standard used by the NFT (e.g., ERC721, ERC1155)

### Utility

The NFT metadata table offers valuable information for NFT analysis and integration, allowing you to:

- Identify NFT collections across different blockchains
- Retrieve essential NFT information for calculations and display
- Cross-reference NFT data with other tables like `tokens.nft_transfers`

The table contains the following columns:

import { ColumnDescriptions } from "/snippets/column-descriptions.mdx";

<ColumnDescriptions tableSchema="tokens" tableName="nft" />

import { TableSample } from "/snippets/table-sample.mdx";

<TableSample tableSchema="tokens" tableName="nft" />

### Network Coverage

NFT metadata is available for all EVM-compatible networks indexed by Dune.

## Sample Queries

**Query NFT collections on a specific blockchain**

This query returns NFT collections on the Ethereum blockchain:

```sql
SELECT
    contract_address,
    name,
    symbol,
    standard
FROM tokens.nft
WHERE blockchain = 'ethereum'
LIMIT 100
```

**Find NFTs with a specific standard across blockchains**

This query finds all NFTs using the ERC721 standard across different blockchains:

```sql
SELECT
    blockchain,
    contract_address,
    name,
    symbol
FROM tokens.nft
WHERE standard = 'erc721'
```

**List NFT collections with a specific keyword in their name**

This query lists NFT collections that have "Punk" in their name:

```sql
SELECT
    blockchain,
    contract_address,
    name,
    symbol,
    standard
FROM tokens.nft
WHERE name LIKE '%Punk%'
ORDER BY blockchain, name
LIMIT 50
```
