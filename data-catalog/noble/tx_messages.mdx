# Table Description

This table contains data about messages contained within transactions in the Noble blockchain, including message types, content, and associated metadata.

<Tip>
On execution, transactions from Cosmos emit data in two formats:
- Messages (`noble.tx_messages`): These provide a high-level, readable summary of actions, such as "send money" or "execute contract." They are easier to understand and track transaction types.
- Events (`noble.message_events`): These capture detailed, low-level changes at the chain level, including underlying blockchain modifications that may not always be directly related to state changes.
- Use Messages for a general overview and Events when you need detailed insights. The two tables are complementary.
