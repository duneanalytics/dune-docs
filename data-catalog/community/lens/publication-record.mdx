## Table description

This holds all the SUCCESSFUL publication records, including Momoka publications; it also has a MIRROR|QUOTE|COMMENT|POST publication type, but the rest of the columns should explain itself. The definition of success to us is if it follows the metadata standard.

## Table Sample

import { TableSample } from "/snippets/table-sample.mdx";

<TableSample tableSchema="dune.lens" tableName="publication_record" />
