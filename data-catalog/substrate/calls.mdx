## Table description

Compared to the `extrinsics` table, which only has a top-level call, the `calls` Substrate table represents _internal_ calls, including recursive internal calls of `proxy` and `utility` (batch) pallets, and provides detailed call arguments for each level of the call tree.

Common queries on the `calls` table will typically filter on `block_time`, `call_section` and `call_method` and extract JSON encoded information in
`data` or `decoded_data`.
