## Table description

The `events` table (e.g. `polkadot.events`) holds all events that occur on the chain, including their pallet `section` and `method`, as well as the decoded data involved in the event.  


Common queries on the `events` table will typically filter on `block_time`, `section` and `ethod` and extract JSON encoded information in
`data` or `decoded_data`.
