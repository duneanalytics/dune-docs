## Table description

Extrinsics (aka "transactions") normally contain a signature, some data to describe if the extrinsic has passed some validity checks and a reference to the pallet and call that it is intended for.  Extrinsics may be signed or unsigned.  Some extrinsics have a complex structure, e.g. when using proxy or utility pallets, resulting in the top-level call initiating other calls involving other pallets.  

Common queries on the `extrinsics` table (e.g. `polkadot.extrinsics`) will typically filter on `block_time`, `section` and `method` and extract JSON encoded information in `data` or `decoded_data`.  In many cases, an initial query on the `extrinsics` table is best developed on the calls table instead to properly capture how users often use proxy and utility constructs to interact with the Substrate chain.
