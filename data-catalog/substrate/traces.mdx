## Table description

The traces table, also known as the "snapshot" table, stores relevant on-chain state data that are otherwise difficult to acquire from base Substrate tables such as extrinsics and events.  The traces tables are populated with special scripts modeling key storage elements at the end of the hour or day.

Having these snapshots enables Dune wizards to build useful dashboards on Dune
such as:
    * [Polkadot Staking](https://dune.com/substrate/polkadot-staking)
    * [Polkadot OpenGov](https://dune.com/substrate/polkadot-gov)
    * [HydraDX OmniPool](https://dune.com/substrate/hydradx)
    * [Interlay Vaults](https://dune.com/substrate/interlay)
