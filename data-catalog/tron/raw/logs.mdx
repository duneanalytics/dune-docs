## Table Description

The `logs` table represents the logs generated by the Tron Virtual Machine (TVM) when a contract is executed. Logs are a way to store data on the blockchain. Logs originate from events that occur during the execution of a smart contract. A log consists of: 
- topic list: a list of 0 to 4 32-byte data topics. `Topic0` is the hash of the signature of the event (indexed), and the remaining topics are indexed parameters of the event.
- data: contains non-indexed data.

While working with raw logs is possible, we recommend working with [decoded logs](../decoded/event-logs) for a more user-friendly experience.
