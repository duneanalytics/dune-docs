import { ColumnDescriptions } from "/snippets/column-descriptions.mdx";
import { TableSample } from "/snippets/table-sample.mdx";

The `succinct.requests` table contains all proof requests submitted by application developers to the Succinct Network. Each request represents a demand for ZK proof generation, which provers can then bid on through the auction mechanism.

## Table Schema

| Column Name | Data Type | Description |
|------------|-----------|-------------|
| vk_hash | binary | Verification key hash for the proof request |
| requester | binary | Address of the application developer submitting the request |
| fulfiller_address | binary | Address of the prover that fulfilled the request |
| gas_price | bigint | Gas price for the request transaction |
| max_price_per_gas | bigint | Maximum price per gas unit the requester is willing to pay |
| gas_used | bigint | Gas used for the request transaction |
| gas_limit | bigint | Gas limit for the request transaction |
| cycles | bigint | Number of computational cycles required for the proof |
| created_at | timestamp | Timestamp when the request was submitted |
| fulfilled_at | timestamp | Timestamp when the request was fulfilled |
| deadline | timestamp | Deadline by which the proof must be generated |
| date | date | Date when the request was submitted |
| tx_hash | binary | Transaction hash of the request submission |
| id | binary | Unique identifier for the proof request |
| sender | binary | Address of the sender (may be different from requester) |
| base_fee | decimal(38,0) | Base fee for the transaction |
| min_auction_period | bigint | Minimum auction period in seconds |
| _updated_at | timestamp | Last update timestamp |
| _ingested_at | timestamp | Ingestion timestamp |

## Sample Query

```sql
-- Get the total number of requests and fulfillment rates by requester
SELECT 
    requester,
    COUNT(*) as total_requests,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN fulfiller_address IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) as fulfilled_requests,
    COUNT(CASE WHEN fulfiller_address IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as fulfillment_rate
FROM succinct.requests
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '30' DAY
GROUP BY requester
ORDER BY total_requests DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## Sample Query

```sql
-- Get request activity and gas usage over time
SELECT 
    DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at) as day,
    COUNT(*) as total_requests,
    AVG(gas_used) as avg_gas_used,
    SUM(gas_used) as total_gas_used
FROM succinct.requests
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '7' DAY
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('day', created_at)
ORDER BY day DESC;
