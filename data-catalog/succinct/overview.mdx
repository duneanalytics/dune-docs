Succinct is a protocol on Ethereum that proves the world's software. It coordinates hardware teams, infrastructure operators, and application developers to facilitate the generation of zero knowledge proofs. Application developers send programs in normal code that are wrapped with SP1 to the Succinct Network, allowing infrastructure and hardware teams (jointly called provers) to compete to generate proofs of the programs' execution.

## Key Features

- **Decentralized Prover Network**: The world's first decentralized protocol for ZK proving, enabling permissionless participation
- **High Performance Architecture**: Verifiable application (vApp) that settles to Ethereum with off-chain auctioneer service and on-chain settlement contracts
- **Competitive Pricing**: Auction-based mechanism where provers compete to generate proofs at the lowest cost
- **PROVE Token**: Native token enabling payments, incentivizing provers, and securing the network through staking and governance
- **Universal Compatibility**: Supports ZK rollups, bridges, games, oracles, AI agents, and more

## Protocol Architecture

The Succinct Network operates as a global, two-sided marketplace composed of provers and requesters. Provers compete to generate ZK proofs of programs submitted by requesters through an auction mechanism called proof contests. The network is architected as a verifiable application that settles to Ethereum, providing high performance while maintaining verifiability.
