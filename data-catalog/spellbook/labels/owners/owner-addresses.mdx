## Table Sample

import { TableSample } from "/snippets/table-sample.mdx";

<TableSample tableSchema="labels" tableName="owner_addresses" />

## Example Query

The following SQL query demonstrates how to retrieve details about addresses owned by 'Coinbase':

```sql
SELECT
  *
FROM
  labels.owner_addresses
 where custody_owner = 'Coinbase'
```

The other way around is also possible, to find the custody owner of specific addresses. Here we match entities that have deposited assets to the ``0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa`` address, which is the ETH 2.0 deposit contract.

```sql
Select
  "from",
  "to",
  value,
  block_date,
  hash,
  custody_owner
from
  ethereum.transactions
  inner join labels.owner_addresses on "from" = labels.owner_addresses.address
where
  "to" = 0x00000000219ab540356cBB839Cbe05303d7705Fa
```
