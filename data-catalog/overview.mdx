# Blockchain Data

Dune provides data for a wide range of blockchains. Our data catalog includes raw data, decoded data, and abstracted data tables for each blockchain.

### EVM Chains

We provide the most comprehensive data catalog for Ethereum Mainnet and EVM-compatible rollups, sidechains and other layer 2 solutions.
All EVM chains on Dune have raw data, decoded data and abstracted data tables available.
