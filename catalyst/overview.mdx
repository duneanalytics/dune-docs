## Integration Options

Dune offers flexible integration routes for both EVM and non-EVM chains, allowing you to easily integrate your blockchain data into the platform. Here are the three primary routes for integration:

### 1. EVM Chains

**What it is:**  
For EVM-based chains, Dune provides a fully-managed, white-glove service approach to integrate blockchain data. This involves ingesting raw data, decoding smart contracts, and curating datasets for deeper analytics. 

**Technical Requirements:**

- **Node Provider**:  
  Your chain will need a reliable node provider, such as QuickNode, Alchemy, Infura, Chainstack, or Tatum.

- **RPC Node Calls**:  
  The RPC node must support the following methods so Dune can transform raw data into Dune’s standard EVM schema for **transactions, logs, traces, and blocks**:
  - `eth_getBlockByNumber` (for blocks/transactions)
  - `eth_getBlockReceipts` (for logs)
  - `debug_traceBlockByNumber` (for traces)
  - `eth_getTransactionReceipt` (alternative for logs)
  - `trace_block` (alternative for traces)

- **Standardized ABIs**:  
  Your chain should support smart contract definitions with standardized ABIs. This typically includes an API endpoint like `[contract_getsourcecode](https://docs.etherscan.io/api-endpoints/contracts#get-contract-source-code-for-verified-contract-source-codes)`, allowing Dune to pull ABIs for contract addresses. The endpoint should provide:
  - Is it a verified contract?
  - ABI: JSON format (potentially stringified)
  - ContractName: string
  - Proxy: boolean
  - Implementation: address of proxy contract (if proxy)

**Example Chains**  
To get a feel for how data on Dune looks for this integration route, check out examples like [Ethereum](/data-catalog/evm/ethereum/overview), [Base](/data-catalog/evm/base/overview), or [Polygon](/data-catalog/evm/polygon/overview).

### 2. Non-EVM Chains: RPC Route

**What it is:**  
For non-EVM chains supporting RPC calls, Dune provides an integration method via node indexing. This setup allows data to flow directly from the blockchain nodes to Dune, transforming it into raw datasets that can be used in analysis and dashboards.

**Technical Requirements:**

- **Node Indexing**: The chain should have a node provider capable of making relevant RPC calls (e.g., `getBlock`, `getTransaction`, or chain-specific alternatives).

**Example Chains**  
To get a feel for how data on Dune looks for this integration route, check out [Solana](/data-catalog/solana/overview), [Bitcoin](/data-catalog/bitcoin/overview), or [Aptos](/data-catalog/aptos/overview).

### 3. Non-EVM Chains: Database Route

**What it is:**  
For chains where an RPC approach isn’t applicable, Dune can integrate data through a database route. This method involves indexing chain data into Dune from datasets that are already transformed and stored in cloud solutions such as AWS S3 or Google Cloud Storage (GCS).

**Technical Requirements:**

- **Data Format**: AVRO (preferred) or Parquet format.
- **Folder Structure**: Data should follow the structure `bucket-name/chain/table-name/yyyy-mm-dd/hh-mm-ss-XXX...XXX.avro`.
- **S3 Bucket**: Must have "requester pays" disabled and be located in the EU.
- **Table Management**: Provide a list of tables, their size, and growth rate (daily or monthly).
- **Data Updates**: Tables are indexed and refreshed hourly (append-only, no row-level updates or deletes).
- **Backfills**: Full table replacements can be requested on a case-by-case basis.
- **Storage Costs**: All Dune storage costs are fully covered.

**Example Chains**  
To explore examples of this integration, check out the data for [Polkadot](/data-catalog/substrate/overview) or [Near](/data-catalog/near/overview).

### Data Latency

Data latency is important to consider when integrating your chain with Dune. The platform ensures fast data availability, but latency varies based on the integration route:

- **EVM Chains & Non-EVM RPC Chains**: These chains aim to stay synchronized with the latest block, minimizing delays to a few seconds or minutes. Dune’s infrastructure ensures minimal latency, allowing you to access real-time data quickly.

- **Non-EVM Database Route**: Data flows from your cloud database into Dune on an hourly basis. This introduces a bit more delay compared to RPC-based integrations, but the data remains highly reliable.

For more detailed information on data freshness and latency, refer to [Dune’s data freshness documentation](/data-catalog/data-freshness).
