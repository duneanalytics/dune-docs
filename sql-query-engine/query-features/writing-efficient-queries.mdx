# Writing Efficient Queries

Best practices for writing performant SQL on Dune.

## Use Partitions

Always filter on partitioned columns when possible:

```sql
-- Good: filters on block_date partition
SELECT * FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_date >= date '2024-01-01'

-- Bad: scans all data
SELECT * FROM ethereum.transactions
WHERE block_time >= timestamp '2024-01-01'
```

## Limit Early

Apply filters as early as possible in your query.

## Avoid SELECT *

Only select columns you need.

## Use Approximate Functions

Use `approx_distinct()` instead of `COUNT(DISTINCT)` when exact counts aren't required.
