# GROUP BY

Group rows for aggregation.

## Basic Grouping

```sql
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as day,
    COUNT(*) as txn_count
FROM ethereum.transactions
GROUP BY 1
```

## Multiple Columns

```sql
SELECT 
    date_trunc('day', block_time) as day,
    "to",
    COUNT(*) as txn_count
FROM ethereum.transactions
GROUP BY 1, 2
```

## HAVING

Filter groups:

```sql
SELECT 
    "from",
    COUNT(*) as txn_count
FROM ethereum.transactions
GROUP BY 1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 100
```

## GROUP BY ROLLUP

```sql
SELECT 
    project,
    blockchain,
    SUM(amount_usd) as volume
FROM dex.trades
GROUP BY ROLLUP (project, blockchain)
```
