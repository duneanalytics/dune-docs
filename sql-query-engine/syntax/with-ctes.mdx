# WITH (CTEs)

Common Table Expressions for organizing complex queries.

## Basic CTE

```sql
WITH daily_volumes AS (
    SELECT 
        date_trunc('day', block_time) as day,
        SUM(amount_usd) as volume
    FROM dex.trades
    GROUP BY 1
)
SELECT * FROM daily_volumes
WHERE volume > 1000000
```

## Multiple CTEs

```sql
WITH 
    cte1 AS (SELECT ...),
    cte2 AS (SELECT ... FROM cte1),
    cte3 AS (SELECT ...)
SELECT * FROM cte2 JOIN cte3 ON ...
```

## When to Use CTEs

- Break complex queries into readable parts
- Reuse subquery results multiple times
- Improve query organization
