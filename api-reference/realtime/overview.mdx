Dune’s realtime multi-chain APIs focus on providing critical information about accounts (wallets).

The two APIs available today are:

<<<<<<< HEAD
1. [Token balances API](./balances): Access accurate and fast (sub 500ms) real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on EVM blockchains.
2. [Chains API](./chains): The endpoint lists the supported blockchains for the token balances API
