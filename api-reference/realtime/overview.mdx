Dune’s realtime multi-chain APIs focus on providing critical information about accounts (wallets).

The APIs available today are:

1. [Token Balances API](./balances): Access accurate and fast (sub 500ms) real time balances of the native and ERC20 tokens of accounts on EVM blockchains.
2. [Chains Endpoint](./chains): The endpoint lists the supported blockchains for the token balances API

<Note> 
- These endpoints are in beta and accessible on a free-trial basis, please contact realtimeAPI@dune.com to inquire about our roadmap and support questions;
</Note>
<Tip>
    - Currently, the token balances supports 22 EVM-compatible chains. See the [chains Endpoint](./chains) for a list of the supported blockchains.
