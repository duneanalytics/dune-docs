Pricing for API is charged along several dimensions. All details can be found at [dune.com/pricing](https://dune.com/pricing).

<Note>
Failed executions are charged. If you execute a query but never pull the results, you are only charged for the execution.
</Note>

## Executions

Credits are consumed based on actual compute resources used for each query execution. The performance tier you select affects credit consumption.

## Data Export

Credits are consumed when exporting query results via API or CSV.

| Plan | Credits per MB Exported |
|------|-------------------------|
| Free | 20 |
| Analyst | 10 |
| Plus | 2 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

## Data Writes

Credits are consumed when writing data (table creation, data insertion, uploads).

| Plan | Credits per GB Written |
|------|------------------------|
| Free | 3 |
| Analyst | 3 |
| Plus | 3 |
| Enterprise | Custom |

<Note>
Minimum charge is 1 credit per write operation.

## Data Transformations Billing

Data Transformations is an Enterprise-only feature with usage-based credit consumption.

### Credit Consumption

#### Compute Credits
- Same as Fluid Engine credits for query execution
- Charged based on actual compute resources used
- Depends on query complexity and execution time

#### Write Operations
- **Minimum 1 credit** per write operation
- Scales with data volume (GB written)
- Applied to INSERT, MERGE, CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, etc.

#### Maintenance Operations
- OPTIMIZE, VACUUM, and ANALYZE operations consume credits
- Based on compute resources and data written during maintenance
- Can be automated with dbt post-hooks

See [dbt Connector documentation](/api-reference/connectors/dbt/overview) for more details.
