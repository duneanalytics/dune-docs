Pricing for API is charged along two dimensions. All details can be found at [dune.com/pricing](https://dune.com/pricing)

| Uploads | 1MB on Free <br></br> 15GB on Plus <br></br> 50GB on Premium |
| CRUD | Available on Plus and Premium |
| Webhooks (Alerts) | 1 on Free <br></br> 5 on Plus <br></br> 50 on Premium |

A datapoint applies to query results after the query is run, and can in most cases be thought of `rows * columns` with an additional limit of 100 avg bytes per cell in a set of results. This can be expressed as: 

```math
Credits = Datapoints/1000 = max(rows*columns, ceil(totalbytes/100))/1000
```

Any API usage billing will be based on what account the API key is associated with. If you use your team api key to call a public query belonging to yourself, the billing will be associated to the team (and vice versa).
