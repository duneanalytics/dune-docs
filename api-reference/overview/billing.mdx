Pricing for API is charged along two dimensions. All details can be found at [dune.com/pricing](https://dune.com/pricing)

<Note>
Failed executions are charged. If you execute a query but never pull the results, you are only charged for the execution.
</Note>

| Dimension | Charge |
|---|---|
| Executions | Credits consumed based on actual compute resources used for each query execution |
| Datapoints (Results) | 1 credit per 1,000 datapoints on Free <br></br> 1 credit per 5,000 datapoints on Plus <br></br> 1 credit per 25,000 datapoints on Premium |
| Storage | 1MB on Free <br></br> 15GB on Plus <br></br> 50GB on Premium |
| Queries Endpoint | Available on Plus and Premium |
| Webhooks (Alerts) | 1 on Free <br></br> 5 on Plus <br></br> 50 on Premium |

A datapoint applies to query results after the query is run, and can in most cases be thought of `rows * columns` with an additional limit of 100 avg bytes per cell in a set of results. This can be expressed as:

$$
Credits = \frac{Datapoints}{1000} = \frac{\max(\text{rows} * \text{columns}, \lceil \frac{\text{totalbytes}}{100} \rceil)}{1000}
$$

**Byte-Based Calculation Details**

When calculating datapoints based on total bytes, cells that exceed 100 bytes will "spill over" into additional cells. Here's how this works:

**Example Table:**
```
+-----+-----+-----+
| A1  | B1  | C1  |
+-----+-----+-----+
| A2  | B2  | C2  |
+-----+-----+-----+
| A3  | B3  | C3  |
+-----+-----+-----+
```

**Spillover Calculation:** If one cell contains 175 bytes, that cell effectively counts as 2 cells in the datapoint calculation:

- First 100 bytes = 1 cell
- Remaining 75 bytes = 1 additional cell

**Example breakdown:**
- 8 cells of 100 bytes each = 8 cells
- 1 cell of 175 bytes = 2 cells (100 + 75)
- Total: 10 cells

**API Usage Billing**

Any API usage billing will be based on what account the API key is associated with. If you use your team API key to call a public query belonging to yourself, the billing will be associated to the team (and vice versa).

## Data Transformations Billing

Data Transformations is an Enterprise-only feature with usage-based credit consumption.

### Credit Consumption

#### Compute Credits
- Same as Fluid Engine credits for query execution
- Charged based on actual compute resources used
- Depends on query complexity and execution time

#### Write Operations
- **Minimum 3 credits** per write operation
- Scales with data volume (GB written)
- Applied to INSERT, MERGE, CREATE TABLE AS SELECT, etc.

#### Storage Credits
- **4 credits per GB per month**
- Calculated based on end-of-day storage usage
- Encourages efficient data management and cleanup

#### Maintenance Operations
- OPTIMIZE, VACUUM, and ANALYZE operations consume credits
- Based on compute resources and data written during maintenance
- Can be automated with dbt post-hooks

See [dbt Connector documentation](/api-reference/connectors/dbt-connector) for more details.
