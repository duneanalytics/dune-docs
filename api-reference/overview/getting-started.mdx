This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started with Dune's APIs, from creating an API key to making your first request.

## 1. Sign Up

Create your account at [dune.com/auth/register](https://dune.com/auth/register)

New accounts come with free credits to get you started.

## 2. Generate API Key

1. Navigate to [API settings page](https://dune.com/apis?tab=keys)
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Give your key a descriptive name (e.g., "Production API", "Development")
4. Copy and securely store your API key

<Note>
- Dune has two types of account: **user** account and **team** account. A team can have many users. A user can join many teams.
- Each user or team account has its own context. Queries created under a team account can only be managed within the team account context.
- An API key belongs to a specific context, and is either associated with a user account or a team account.
</Note>

  />
</div>

<Note>
**Keep your API key secure!** Treat it like a password. Never commit it to version control or share it publicly. Anyone with your API key can make requests on your behalf and consume your credits.
</Note>

## 3. Authenticate

Use your API key to authenticate requests to Dune's APIs. Include it in your request headers:

```bash
X-DUNE-API-KEY: your-api-key-here
```

### Initialize the SDK

<CodeGroup>
```python Python
from dune_client import DuneClient
import os

# Use environment variable for security
dune = DuneClient(api_key=os.environ.get("DUNE_API_KEY"))
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { DuneClient } from '@duneanalytics/client-sdk';

// Use environment variable for security
const dune = new DuneClient(process.env.DUNE_API_KEY);
```

```go Go
import "github.com/duneanalytics/duneapi-client-go"
import "os"

// Use environment variable for security
client := duneapi.New(os.Getenv("DUNE_API_KEY"))
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
**Best practices:**
- Store API keys in environment variables
- Create separate keys for development and production
- Rotate keys periodically
- Revoke keys immediately if compromised
</Tip>

## 4. Start Building

Use your API key to make requests to Dune's APIs. Here's a simple example to get recent DEX trades:

<CodeGroup>
```bash cURL
# Execute a SQL query
curl -X POST "https://api.dune.com/api/v1/sql/execute" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "X-DUNE-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d '{
    "sql": "SELECT * FROM dex.trades WHERE block_time > now() - interval '\''1'\'' day LIMIT 10",
    "performance": "medium"
  }'
```

```python Python
from dune_client import DuneClient

dune = DuneClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

# Execute a SQL query
sql = """
SELECT * FROM dex.trades 
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '1' day 
LIMIT 10
"""

results = dune.run_sql(query_sql=sql)
print(results.get_rows())
```

```typescript TypeScript
import { DuneClient } from '@duneanalytics/client-sdk';

const dune = new DuneClient('YOUR_API_KEY');

// Execute a saved query
const executionResult = await dune.runQuery({ queryId: 3493826 });
console.log(executionResult.result?.rows);
```
</CodeGroup>

### Understanding the Response

The API returns an execution object with your query status:

```json
{
  "execution_id": "01K9AHMWSJZD59KAGB3WY45895",
  "state": "QUERY_STATE_EXECUTING",
  "submitted_at": "2025-11-05T17:39:48.146829Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-02-03T17:39:48.329665Z"
}
```

<Note>
Queries execute asynchronously. Use the `execution_id` to check status and retrieve results. Our SDKs handle polling automatically.
</Note>

### Getting Results

Once execution completes, fetch the results:

```bash
curl "https://api.dune.com/api/v1/execution/{execution_id}/results" \
  -H "X-DUNE-API-KEY: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
