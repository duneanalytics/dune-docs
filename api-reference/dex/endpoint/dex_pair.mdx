<Note>
- Query can be found [here](https://dune.com/queries/3568055)
- Chains included are: `arbitrum`, `base`, `bnb`, `celo`, `ethereum`, `fantom`, `gnosis`, `optimism`, `polygon`, `scroll`, `zk_sync`, `solana`
- Scheduled to update every 30 minutes
- You can apply [filters](../../executions/filtering) like WHERE, IN, AND/OR upon results
- Each row is uniquely identified by the `chain`, `token_a_address`, and `token_b_address` columns combination.
</Note>

# Use Cases 

- Enable DEX aggregators to identify all pools for swapping specific token pairs or addresses, using filters such as `filter='USDC-WETH'` or `filters=token_a_address = '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48' or token_b_address = '0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48'`.
- Identify the token pair with the highest USD liquidity on a given chain by sorting results with `sort_by=usd_liquidity desc`.
- Provide aggregated DEX pair statistics, including volume and liquidity, to algorithmic trading bots and risk management systems.
