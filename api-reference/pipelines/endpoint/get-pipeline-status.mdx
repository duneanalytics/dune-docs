title: 'Get Pipeline Execution Status'
openapi: 'GET /v1/pipelines/executions/{pipeline_execution_id}/status'
---

This endpoint retrieves the status of a pipeline execution, including the status of each node (query or materialized view refresh) in the pipeline.

## Understanding Pipeline Status

A pipeline execution contains multiple nodes, each representing either:
- **Query Execution**: A query that's part of the pipeline
- **Materialized View Refresh**: A materialized view that's refreshed as part of the pipeline

Each node has its own status and can be tracked independently.

## Pipeline States

The overall pipeline can be in one of the following states:
- `pending`: Pipeline execution has been queued but not yet started
- `executing`: Pipeline is currently running
- `completed`: All nodes in the pipeline have completed successfully

## Node Status

Each node in the pipeline includes:
- `node_id`: Unique identifier for the node
- `status`: Current state of the node execution
- `query_execution_status` or `materialized_view_refresh_status`: Detailed status information

## Response Structure

The 200 response includes:
- `status`: Overall pipeline execution status (pending, executing, or completed)
- `node_executions`: Array of individual node executions with their status and results

## Example Usage

```bash
# Check pipeline status
curl "https://api.dune.com/api/v1/pipelines/executions/01HZABC123.../status" \
  -H "X-Dune-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Tip>
Poll this endpoint periodically to monitor pipeline execution progress. Each node's status will update as the pipeline progresses through its execution.
</Tip>

## Monitoring Pipeline Progress

You can use this endpoint to:
- Track which nodes have completed and which are still running
- Identify any nodes that have failed
- Retrieve execution IDs for individual queries to fetch their results
- Monitor overall pipeline health

<Note>
Once a pipeline execution completes, you can retrieve the results of individual queries using their respective execution IDs from the node status.
