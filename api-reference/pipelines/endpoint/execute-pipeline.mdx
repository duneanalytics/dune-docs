title: 'Execute Pipeline'
openapi: 'POST /v1/pipelines/execute'
---

This endpoint builds an execution pipeline from a specified query and executes it. The pipeline will automatically include all materialized views in the query's lineage, ensuring coordinated execution of dependent queries.

## How It Works

When you execute a pipeline using this endpoint:

1. **Lineage Detection**: Dune analyzes the query to identify all materialized views it depends on
2. **Pipeline Construction**: A pipeline is automatically built that includes all dependencies in the correct order
3. **Coordinated Execution**: All queries and materialized view refreshes are executed as a single unit
4. **Status Tracking**: Returns a `pipeline_execution_id` for monitoring progress

## Key Differences from Query Pipeline Execute

This endpoint differs from the [Execute Query Pipeline](/api-reference/executions/endpoint/execute-query-pipeline) endpoint:

| Feature | Execute Pipeline | Execute Query Pipeline |
|---------|------------------|------------------------|
| **Endpoint** | `POST /v1/pipelines/execute` | `POST /v1/query/{query_id}/pipeline/execute` |
| **Query ID** | In request body | In URL path |
| **Lineage** | Automatically includes all materialized views | Executes predefined pipeline |
| **Use Case** | Dynamic pipeline based on query dependencies | Predefined pipeline execution |

## Request Body

The request body accepts:
- `query_id` (required): The unique identifier of the query to execute
- `performance` (optional): Execution tier - `medium` (default) or `large`
- `query_parameters` (optional): SQL query parameters as JSON key-value pairs

## Use Cases

This endpoint is ideal for:
- **Dependency Management**: Automatically refreshing all materialized views a query depends on
- **Consistent Updates**: Ensuring all dependent data is fresh before query execution
- **Dynamic Pipelines**: When you want to execute based on runtime query dependencies
- **Simplified Workflow**: No need to manually define pipeline structure

## Monitoring Pipeline Execution

After executing the pipeline:

1. Save the returned `pipeline_execution_id`
2. Use the [Get Pipeline Execution Status](/api-reference/pipelines/endpoint/get-pipeline-status) endpoint to monitor progress
3. Track the status of each materialized view refresh and query execution
4. Retrieve results once the pipeline completes

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Execute pipeline for query ID 1234567
curl -X POST "https://api.dune.com/api/v1/pipelines/execute" \
  -H "X-Dune-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "query_id": 1234567,
    "performance": "medium",
    "query_parameters": {
      "start_date": "2024-01-01",
      "end_date": "2024-12-31"
    }
  }'

# Response: { "pipeline_execution_id": "01HZABC123..." }

# 2. Check pipeline status
curl "https://api.dune.com/api/v1/pipelines/executions/01HZABC123.../status" \
  -H "X-Dune-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```

<Note>
This endpoint automatically determines which materialized views need to be refreshed based on the query's lineage. You don't need to manually specify dependencies.
</Note>

## Performance Considerations

- **Medium tier**: Best for most queries with standard dependencies
- **Large tier**: Use for complex queries with many dependencies or large materialized views
- Credits are consumed based on actual compute resources used for each node in the pipeline

<Tip>
If your query depends on multiple materialized views, this endpoint will refresh all of them in the correct order before executing your query, ensuring data consistency.
