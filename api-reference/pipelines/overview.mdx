The pipeline endpoints enable you to execute and monitor query pipelines - a powerful feature that allows you to chain multiple queries together and execute them as a coordinated workflow.

## What are Query Pipelines?

Query pipelines are sequences of related queries that execute in a specific order based on their dependencies. Instead of executing individual queries separately, pipelines allow you to:

- **Define Dependencies**: Specify which queries depend on the results of other queries
- **Atomic Execution**: Execute all queries in the pipeline as a single unit
- **Coordinated Updates**: Ensure related queries are always executed together
- **Track Progress**: Monitor the status of each query in the pipeline

## How Pipelines Work

1. **Inspect Pipeline**: Use the [Get Query Pipeline](/api-reference/queries/endpoint/get-query-pipeline) endpoint to view the pipeline structure
2. **Execute Pipeline**: Use the [Execute Pipeline](./endpoint/execute-pipeline) endpoint or [Execute Query Pipeline](/api-reference/executions/endpoint/execute-query-pipeline) endpoint
3. **Monitor Progress**: Poll the [Get Pipeline Execution Status](./endpoint/get-pipeline-status) endpoint to track execution
4. **Retrieve Results**: Once complete, access results for each query using their individual execution IDs

## Pipeline Components

A pipeline execution consists of multiple **nodes**, where each node can be:
- **Query Execution**: A DuneSQL query that runs as part of the pipeline
- **Materialized View Refresh**: A materialized view that gets refreshed during pipeline execution

Each node has its own execution status and can be tracked independently.

## Common Use Cases

### Data Transformation Pipelines
Build multi-stage data processing workflows where each stage depends on the previous one:
- Stage 1: Extract raw data
- Stage 2: Transform and clean data
- Stage 3: Aggregate results
- Stage 4: Generate final metrics

### Coordinated Dashboard Updates
Ensure all queries powering a dashboard are executed together with fresh data:
- Execute all dependent queries in the correct order
- Maintain consistency across related metrics
- Update materialized views that feed into dashboard queries

### Incremental Data Processing
Process data incrementally through multiple dependent steps:
- Process new transactions
- Update aggregated tables
- Refresh summary statistics
- Update trend indicators

## Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [Execute Pipeline](./endpoint/execute-pipeline) | `POST /v1/pipelines/execute` | Builds and executes a pipeline including all materialized views in the query's lineage |
| [Get Pipeline Execution Status](./endpoint/get-pipeline-status) | `GET /v1/pipelines/executions/{pipeline_execution_id}/status` | Retrieves the status of a pipeline execution including all nodes |

## Related Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| [Get Query Pipeline](/api-reference/queries/endpoint/get-query-pipeline) | `GET /v1/query/{query_id}/pipeline` | Retrieves the pipeline definition for a query, including all dependencies and execution order |
| [Execute Query Pipeline](/api-reference/executions/endpoint/execute-query-pipeline) | `POST /v1/query/{query_id}/pipeline/execute` | Executes a predefined query pipeline starting from the specified query |

## Pipeline vs. Regular Query Execution

| Feature | Regular Execution | Pipeline Execution |
|---------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Queries** | Single query | Multiple dependent queries |
| **Coordination** | Manual | Automatic |
| **Dependencies** | None | Enforced by pipeline |
| **Monitoring** | Per-query | Unified view of all nodes |
| **Use Case** | Independent analysis | Complex workflows |

<Tip>
Use [Execute Pipeline](./endpoint/execute-pipeline) for automatic lineage-based execution or [Execute Query Pipeline](/api-reference/executions/endpoint/execute-query-pipeline) for predefined pipelines. Then monitor progress with the [Get Pipeline Execution Status](./endpoint/get-pipeline-status) endpoint using the returned `pipeline_execution_id`.
</Tip>

## Credits and Performance

Pipeline executions consume credits based on:
- The performance tier selected (medium or large)
- Actual compute resources used by each query in the pipeline
- Number of queries and complexity of operations

You can specify the performance tier when executing the pipeline to optimize for speed or cost.

<Note>
Pipelines are created and configured in the Dune web application. The API endpoints allow you to execute and monitor existing pipelines programmatically.
