The account management endpoints allow you to monitor and track your API usage, credit consumption, and billing information.

## Usage Tracking

The usage endpoint provides detailed information about your account's resource consumption, including:

- Credits consumed
- Query executions
- Dashboard usage
- Storage utilization

This data helps you monitor your usage patterns and manage your billing effectively.

## Billing Periods

Usage data can be retrieved for specific time periods by providing start and end dates. When no timeframe is specified, the endpoint returns data for the current billing period.

<Note>
The usage endpoint is a metadata endpoint and does not consume credits when called.
