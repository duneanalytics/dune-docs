These query management endpoints help you programmatically create and manage Dune SQL queries via the API, ideal for integration with GitHub or other CI/CD pipelines.

### Queries

Queries all have a `query id` which is returned when you read/create a query. You can also find it within a url, i.e. `https://dune.com/queries/<query_id>/<visualization_id>`.

Each query comes with fields you can edit such as:
- `name`: query name text
- `description`: query description text
- `query_sql`: the raw sql text
- `params`: parameters within the query, using the `{{ foo }}` syntax. See the section below for more details.
- `is_private`: boolean for if query is private or not. Private queries cannot be found or queried by others.
- `archived`: boolean for if query is archived or not. Archived queries cannot run or edited by anyone.

### Query Parameters

There are four kinds of parameters you can use in a Dune query (these are not API parameters). 

- number
- text
- date
- enum (called a list in the UI)

For passing these parameters through the API request body, you can use the following format for executions:

```json
{
"foo": "value",
"bar":1000, 
"baz": "2020-12-01T01:20:30Z"
}
```
Where "foo", "bar", and "baz" are three params in a query. If you leave one out, it goes with the default param valiue.

For Queries endpoints, you'll need to define the type and more:

```json
[
    {
        "key": "block_time_start",
        "type": "datetime",
        "value": "2017-01-01 00:00:00"
    },
    {
        "key": "from",
        "type": "text",
        "value": "0xae2fc483527b8ef99eb5d9b44875f005ba1fae13"
    },
    {
        "key": "limit",
        "type": "number",
        "value": "20"
    },
    {
        "key": "type",
        "type": "enum",
        "value": "DynamicFee",
        "enumOptions": [
            "DynamicFee",
            "Legacy"
        ]
    }
]
```

Note that the `datetime` parameter type requires you use the syntax `timestamp '{{block_time_start}}'` to cast the parameter to a timestamp. 

If you are using bytearrays/binary (`0x1234...`), then you will still pass it as text through the API but ensure your SQL text puts the parameter without any quotes around it.
