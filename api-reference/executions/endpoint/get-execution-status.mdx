title: 'Get Execution Status'
openapi: 'GET /v1/execution/{execution_id}/status'
---

You must pass the `execution_id` obtained from making an [execute query](/api-reference/executions/endpoint/execute-query) POST request. 

Returns the status of a query execution along with relevant metadata of the results if the execution is completed.

## Execution States

Once an execution is triggered, it can be in one of the following states:

- `QUERY_STATE_PENDING`: The query execution is waiting for an execution slot.
- `QUERY_STATE_EXECUTING`: The query is currently executing.
- `QUERY_STATE_FAILED`: The query execution failed. This is a terminal state.
- `QUERY_STATE_COMPLETED`: The query execution completed successfully. You can retrieve the query result for this execution_id.
- `QUERY_STATE_CANCELED`: The query execution was canceled by the user.
- `QUERY_STATE_EXPIRED`: The query execution expired, and the result is no longer available.
- `QUERY_STATE_COMPLETED_PARTIAL`: The query execution was successful, but the result was truncated because it was too large. To receive the truncated result, set the `allow_partial_results` flag to `true` in the API request to fetch the result.
