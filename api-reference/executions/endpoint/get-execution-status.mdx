title: 'Get Execution Status'
openapi: 'GET /v1/execution/{execution_id}/status'
---

You must pass the `execution_id` obtained from making an [execute query](/api-reference/executions/endpoint/execute-query) or [execute SQL](/api-reference/executions/endpoint/execute-sql) POST request. 

Returns the status of a query execution along with relevant metadata of the results if the execution is completed. **This endpoint now includes detailed error information when a query fails**, eliminating the need to call the results endpoint just to get error details.

## Pricing

This endpoint has **no charge** and does not consume credits.

## Execution States

Once an execution is triggered, it can be in one of the following states:

- `QUERY_STATE_PENDING`: The query execution is waiting for an execution slot.
- `QUERY_STATE_EXECUTING`: The query is currently executing.
- `QUERY_STATE_FAILED`: The query execution failed. This is a terminal state. **The response will include detailed error information.**
- `QUERY_STATE_COMPLETED`: The query execution completed successfully. You can retrieve the query result for this execution_id.
- `QUERY_STATE_CANCELED`: The query execution was canceled by the user.
- `QUERY_STATE_EXPIRED`: The query execution expired, and the result is no longer available.
- `QUERY_STATE_COMPLETED_PARTIAL`: The query execution was successful, but the result was truncated because it was too large. To receive the truncated result, set the `allow_partial_results` flag to `true` in the API request to fetch the result.

## Error Response Fields

When a query execution fails (`QUERY_STATE_FAILED`), the response includes an `error` object with the following fields:

- **type** (string): Error type classification (e.g., `FAILED_TYPE_EXECUTION_FAILED`)
- **message** (string): Detailed error message explaining what went wrong, including line and column information
- **metadata** (object): Additional error context
  - **line** (integer): Line number where the error occurred
  - **column** (integer): Column position where the error occurred
