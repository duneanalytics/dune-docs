title: 'Execute Query Pipeline'
openapi: 'POST /v1/query/{query_id}/pipeline/execute'
---

This endpoint builds a query pipeline from the specified query and executes it. A pipeline allows you to chain multiple queries together and execute them as a single unit.

## What is a Query Pipeline?

A query pipeline enables you to create a chain of dependencies between queries, where:
- Each query in the pipeline can depend on the results of previous queries
- The pipeline executes queries in the correct order based on their dependencies
- All queries are executed as a single atomic operation

## Use Cases

Query pipelines are ideal for:
- **Complex Data Transformations**: Breaking down complex analysis into smaller, manageable queries
- **Data Lineage**: Maintaining clear dependencies between related queries
- **Coordinated Updates**: Ensuring multiple queries are executed together
- **Incremental Processing**: Building data pipelines where each step depends on the previous one

## Response

The endpoint returns a `pipeline_execution_id` which you can use to:
1. Check the status of the pipeline execution using the [Get Pipeline Execution Status](/api-reference/pipelines/endpoint/get-pipeline-status) endpoint
2. Monitor the progress of individual nodes in the pipeline
3. Retrieve results from each query in the pipeline once execution completes

<Note>
- Credits are consumed based on actual compute resources used for each query in the pipeline
- Use the `performance` parameter to specify execution tier (medium or large)
- Query parameters can be passed to parameterize queries in the pipeline
</Note>

## Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Execute the pipeline
curl -X POST "https://api.dune.com/api/v1/query/1234567/pipeline/execute" \
  -H "X-Dune-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"

# Response: { "pipeline_execution_id": "01HZABC123..." }

# 2. Check pipeline status
curl "https://api.dune.com/api/v1/pipelines/executions/01HZABC123.../status" \
  -H "X-Dune-Api-Key: YOUR_API_KEY"
```
