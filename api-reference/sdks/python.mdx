We currently support a [Python SDK](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client) for working with our API. You'll find `Python SDK` snippets on all endpoint pages. If you want to go deeper into the code, check out [these files](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client/tree/main/dune_client/api).

## Installation

To install the SDK, run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install dune-client
```

<Warning>
Be sure you are using the latest release. You can find all release versions [here](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client/releases) - there may be code added to the repo that has not been put into a release yet.
</Warning>

## Quick Start

Initialize the client with your API key:

```python
from dune_client.client import DuneClient

# Initialize client
dune = DuneClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")
```

## Working with Queries

You will commonly work with the `QueryBase` class which can be created like this:

```python
from dune_client.query import QueryBase
from dune_client.types import QueryParameter

query = QueryBase(
    name="Sample Query",
    query_id=1215383,
    params=[
        QueryParameter.text_type(name="TextField", value="Word"),
        QueryParameter.number_type(name="NumberField", value=3.1415926535),
        QueryParameter.date_type(name="DateField", value="2022-05-04 00:00:00"),
        QueryParameter.enum_type(name="EnumField", value="Option 1"),
    ],
)
print("Results available at", query.url())
```

The query object is defined as `QueryBase` and all properties can be found [in this file](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client/blob/main/dune_client/query.py).

## Executing Queries

Execute a query and get results:

```python
from dune_client.client import DuneClient
from dune_client.query import QueryBase

dune = DuneClient(api_key="YOUR_API_KEY")

query = QueryBase(
    name="Sample Query",
    query_id=1215383,
)

# Execute the query
results = dune.run_query(query)
```

## Working with Results

Other classes such as execution results can be [found here](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client/blob/main/dune_client/models.py#L244C7-L244C22), detailing operations like `ResultsResponse.get_rows()` for getting the data out of a GET request.

### Using Pandas DataFrames

If you are trying to load data into a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the following function from the SDK:

```python
# Get results as a DataFrame
results_df = dune.run_query_dataframe(query)
```
