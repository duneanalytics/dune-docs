    We currently support a [Python SDK](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client) for working with our API. You'll find `Python SDK` snippets on all endpoint pages, if you want to go deeper into the code then check out [these files](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client/tree/main/dune_client/api).

    To still the SDK, run the following command in your terminal:

    ```bash
    pip install dune-client
    ```

    <Warning>
    Be sure you are using the latest release. You can find all release versions [here](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client/releases) - there may be code added to the repo that has not been put into a release yet.
    </Warning>

    You will commonly work with the `QueryBase` class which can be created like this: 

    ```python
    from dune_client.types import QueryParameter
    from dune_client.client import DuneClient
    from dune_client.query import QueryBase

    query = QueryBase(
        name="Sample Query",
        query_id=1215383,
        params=[
            QueryParameter.text_type(name="TextField", value="Word"),
            QueryParameter.number_type(name="NumberField", value=3.1415926535),
            QueryParameter.date_type(name="DateField", value="2022-05-04 00:00:00"),
            QueryParameter.enum_type(name="EnumField", value="Option 1"),
        ],
    )
    print("Results available at", query.url())
    ```

    The query object is defined as `QueryBase` and all properties can be found [in this file](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client/blob/main/dune_client/query.py).

    Other classes such as execution results can be [found here](https://github.com/duneanalytics/dune-client/blob/main/dune_client/models.py#L244C7-L244C22), detailing operations like `ResultsResponse.get_rows()` for getting the data out of a GET request.

    If you are trying to load data into a Pandas DataFrame, you can use the following function from the sdk.

    ```python
    results_df = dune.run_query_dataframe(query)
    ```

    For a comprehensive overview of all available features, please refer to the [complete Python SDK documentation](./python).

    We have a community client from that can be [found here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@duneanalytics/client-sdk).

    To install, run this command 

    ```bash 
    yarn add @duneanalytics/client-sdk
    ```

    Currently this client only supports the execution based endpoints, and not Query Endpoints or uploads. Here is an example query:

    ```typescript
    import { QueryParameter, DuneClient } from "@duneanalytics/client-sdk";
    const { DUNE_API_KEY } = process.env;

    const client = new DuneClient(DUNE_API_KEY ?? "");
    const queryID = 1215383;
    const params = {
      query_parameters = [
        QueryParameter.text("TextField", "Plain Text"),
        QueryParameter.number("NumberField", 3.1415926535),
        QueryParameter.date("DateField", "2022-05-04 00:00:00"),
        QueryParameter.enum("ListField", "Option 1"),
      ]
    };

    client
      .runQuery(queryID, params)
      .then((executionResult) => console.log(executionResult.result?.rows));
    ```
