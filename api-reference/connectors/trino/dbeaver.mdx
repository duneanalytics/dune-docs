  <Step title="Finish connection setup">
    Once you have all the details filled out properly, click <b>Finish</b> to create the connection.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Run a Test Query

After configuring your connection, you can run a query to verify that everything is working.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open SQL editor">
    Right-click on your Dune database connection and navigate to the <b>SQL Editor</b> section. This will open up a new SQL editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Write your SQL query">
    In the SQL editor, you can write all of your Dune-compatible SQL. Paste the example query below into the editor.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run the script">
    Click the <b>Run</b> button to execute your script. If everything went well, you will see the results displayed in the results panel.

      />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
</Steps>

You can use this query to test your connection. It fetches the daily transaction count from the last year on Base.

```sql
SELECT
  date_trunc('day', block_time) AS time,
  count(*) AS count
FROM base.transactions
WHERE block_time > now() - interval '12' month
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 1 DESC
```
