<Note>
Any of the supported client applications listed in the [Trino ecosystem](https://trino.io/ecosystem/#official-client-applications) are supported. Please visit their documentation to learn about their specific connection instructions, though the configuration should generally follow the same pattern using the connection parameters below.
</Note>

## Connection Parameters

Use these values in your Trino, Presto, or Starburst client configuration:

| Parameter   | Value                     | Description                        |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Host        | `trino.api.dune.com`      | Dune's Trino/Presto endpoint       |
| Port        | `443`                     | Standard HTTPS port                |
| Username    | `dune`                    | Fixed username for all connections |
| Password    | `<your-dune-api-key>`     | [Your Dune API key](/api-reference/overview/authentication) |
| Catalog     | `delta_prod`              | Main data catalog                  |
| SSL/TLS     | `true`                    | Always use encrypted connections   |
| HTTP scheme | `https`                   | Required for secure connections    |

<Note>
If you need an API key, see our guide on [Authentication](/api-reference/overview/authentication). Remember to keep your API keys secret and rotate them immediately if they are ever exposed.
</Note>

## Supported SQL Operations

Queries executed via the connector align with what you can run on the Dune platform. See the [Query Engine overview](/query-engine/overview) for more information on supported functions and syntax.

## Rate Limits

Rate limits for the connector mirror those of the Dune Analytics API. Please refer to the [Rate Limits](/api-reference/overview/rate-limits) documentation for details.

## Billing & Cost

All queries run via the connector are executed on the [Large Query Engine](/query-engine/query-executions#query-engine-size). Credits are consumed based on actual compute resources used. In addition, fetching results consumes credits proportional to the number of datapoints returned. For a full breakdown, please see our documentation on [Billing](/api-reference/overview/billing).

## Limitations

The connector currently has limited support for metadata discovery queries such as `SHOW TABLES` or `SHOW SCHEMAS`. This may impact the data source browsing and autocomplete experience within some BI tools.

For schema and table discovery, see the [Data Explorer](/web-app/query-editor/data-explorer) guide. If you encounter timeouts with large result sets, consider paginating your queries using `LIMIT` and `OFFSET`, narrowing your filters, or splitting complex queries into smaller, more manageable parts.
