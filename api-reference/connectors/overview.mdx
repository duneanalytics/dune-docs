## Overview

Dune's connectors allow you to access blockchain data directly in your own environment, giving you maximum flexibility to integrate with existing data infrastructure and BI tools.

Both connectors use the same Trino endpoint (`trino.api.dune.com`), but serve different purposes:
- **Trino Connector**: Read-only access for querying Dune's data
- **dbt Connector**: Write-enabled access for data transformations (requires `transformations=true` session property)
