In this quickstart, we will walk through how to upload a CSV file to Dune via Python. 

### Prerequisites
- Python environment set up (check out [Anaconda Navigator](https://docs.continuum.io/free/navigator/) if you want somewhere to start.)
- Have a Dune API key (to obtain one [follow the steps here](../overview/authentication#generate-an-api-key))

<Tip> 
Save your Dune API key in a .env file. 
```
DUNE_API_KEY=<paste your API key here>
```
</Tip>

### Upload the CSV
Follow the below steps to upload your CSV. Please make sure to modify paths to your .env file and to your CSV file. 

```python
import dotenv, os
from dune_client.client import DuneClient

# change the current working directory where .env file lives
os.chdir("/Users/abc/project")
# load .env file
dotenv.load_dotenv(".env")
# setup Dune Python client
dune = DuneClient.from_env()

# define path to your CSV file 
csv_file_path = '<CSV_FILE_PATH>'

with open(csv_file_path) as open_file:
    data = open_file.read()

    table = dune.upload_csv(
        data=str(data),
        description="Data about 80 cereals, sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals",
        table_name="cereal_table", # define your table name here
        is_private=False
    )
```

Once the upload is successful, you will see the data show up under [Your Data](https://dune.com/queries?category=uploaded_data) in the Data Explorer. 

You can query your uploaded table under the name `dune.<team or user handle>.dataset_<table name defined>`. For example, here I defined the table name to be "cereal_table" and my team name is "dune", so to access the uploaded table we will do `select * from dune.dune.dataset_cereal_table`.
