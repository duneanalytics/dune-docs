In this quickstart, we will walk through how to upload a CSV file to Dune via Python. 
### Upload the CSV
Follow below steps to upload your CSV.
```python
from dune_client.client import DuneClient

# setup Dune Python client
dune = DuneClient()

# define path to your CSV file 
csv_file_path = '<CSV_FILE_PATH>'

with open(csv_file_path) as open_file:
    data = open_file.read()

    table = dune.upload_csv(
        data=str(data),
        description="Data about 80 cereals, sourced from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/crawford/80-cereals",
        table_name="cereal_table", # define your table name here
        is_private=False
    )
```

Once the upload is successful, you will see the data show up under [Your Data](https://dune.com/queries?category=uploaded_data) in the Data Explorer. 

You can query your uploaded table under the name `dune.<team or user handle>.dataset_<table name defined>`. For example, here I defined the table name to be "cereal_table" and my team name is "dune", so to access the uploaded table we will do `select * from dune.dune.dataset_cereal_table`
