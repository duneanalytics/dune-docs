The materialized views endpoints allow you to create, manage, and refresh materialized views programmatically via the API.

<Note>
Materialized views contribute to your storage quota. On the free tier you can only create a 1MB materialized view. Learn more at [dune.com/pricing](https://dune.com/pricing)
</Note>

## Naming Convention

Materialized view names must follow these rules:

- The full name qualifier is `dune.<your_team>.<name>`
- The name (last part) must be prefixed with `result_`
- Example: `dune.myteam.result_daily_volume`

## Endpoints

Below is an overview of each endpoint for managing materialized views.

| Endpoint Title | Endpoint | Description |
|----------------|----------|-------------|
| [Get Materialized View](./get) | `GET /v1/materialized-views/{name}` | Retrieves details about a specific materialized view |
| [Upsert Materialized View](./create) | `POST /v1/materialized-views` | Creates a new materialized view or updates an existing one |
| [Delete Materialized View](./delete) | `DELETE /v1/materialized-views/{name}` | Removes a materialized view |
| [List Materialized Views](./list) | `GET /v1/materialized-views` | Lists all materialized views for your account |
| [Refresh Materialized View](./refresh) | `POST /v1/materialized-views/{name}/refresh` | Triggers a refresh to update the materialized view with latest data |

## Refresh and Performance Tiers

Each refresh of a materialized view triggers a query execution and consumes credits based on the performance level:

- **Medium**: Extended timeout, 1x compute, priority queue. Best for most queries.
- **Large**: Extended timeout, 2x compute, priority queue. For complex queries with joins across large tables.

You can set a refresh schedule using cron expressions (minimum 15 minutes, maximum weekly) when creating or updating a materialized view.
