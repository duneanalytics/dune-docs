<Note>
- This endpoint will create a new matview if none exists for the given query ID, or update an existing one if the query ID matches.
- It will fail to create a matview with the same name as an existing one, but for a different query ID
- The name of the matview is just the last part of the matview, not including `dune.<your_team>.` and must be prefixed with `result_`
- The `cron_expression` parameter must be passed in as a valid 5 section cron expression. [See here](https://crontab.guru/) for how to write them.
</Note>

<Tip>
- The cron expression interval must be at least 15 minutes and at most weekly
