title: 'Refresh Materialized View'
openapi: 'POST /v1/materialized-views/{name}/refresh'
---


<Note>
- By default, the refresh runs on the `medium` engine. To boost performance, pass in a JSON body with `{"performance": "large"}`. Credits are consumed based on actual compute resources used for the refresh operation.
- If you prefer `medium` performance, you can omit the `performance` parameter.
- You must own the materialized view to refresh it.
</Note>

<Tip>
- After triggering the refresh, you can check the status by passing the returned `execution_id` into the [Get Execution Status endpoint](/api-reference/executions/endpoint/get-execution-status).
- To find the name of a materialized view:
    <div
    style={{
        position: "relative",
        paddingBottom: "69.583%", // Aspect ratio of 1200 by 835
        height: 0,
        width: "100%",
    }}
    >
    <iframe
        src="https://demo.arcade.software/z3uWy6IbZUhKdXRyExL0?embed"
        title="Parameter demo"
        frameBorder={0}
        loading="lazy"
        webkitallowfullscreen=""
        mozallowfullscreen=""
        allowFullScreen=""
        style={{
        position: "absolute",
        top: 0,
        left: 0,
        width: "100%",
        height: "100%",
        }}
    />
    </div>
