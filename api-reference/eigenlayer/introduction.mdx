Leverage Dune's API for direct access to [EigenLayer](https://www.eigenlayer.xyz/) data, streamlining your dApp and infrastructure development. No SQL neededâ€”our Domain-specific API is designed for easy integration and flexible application use.

- **JSON Format**: All endpoints deliver JSON-formatted data for straightforward integration.
- **Instant Access**: Begin immediately by [creating a free account](https://dune.com/auth/register) and [obtain an API key](.././overview/authentication).
- **Expansive Data Ecosystem**: Enhance your projects by connecting with an extensive range of on-chain and off-chain data, from [Farcaster](.././farcaster/introduction) to [DEX](../dex/endpoint/dex_pair.mdx) and more. Build alongside our vibrant community.
